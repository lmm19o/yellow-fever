From this it appears that the maximum monthly mortality was no
greater during the summer months of 1878 than during the same months
in 1877. Both years having been considered unusually healthful.
Just prior to the outbreak of yellow fever, more cases of malarial fever
were observed than at any time during the past four years. Yet they
were not of a fatal character and yielded readily to efficient treatment.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, all the malarial manifestations
seemed to disappear, though many of our physicians believed the two
acted together. I am not a believer in the over-lapping, roof-shingling
style claimed by some for these diseasess.
SANITARY CONDITION.
Although a strong advocate of the strictest sanitary regulations, I think
it unwarrantable to say that our lack of perfect cleanliness gave us yellow
fever in 1878. -
Our drainage was imperfect, our vault privy system undesirable, the
proper disposition of garbage neglected, and our sanitary regulations
generally lax. Yet the sanitary condition of the place compared favora-
bly with itself in previous years, and with almost any place of like di-
mensions.
No sooner had we sniffed the tainted gale of the pestilence as it was
wafted from our stricken sister cities of the South, than our people went to
work, each sweeping his own door-yard, and contributing to effect a state
of general cleanliness.
The streets and gutters were in many places streaming with lime and
copperas, carbolic acid was at first generally and largely used, but with
doubtful efficacy. House to house inspection was not practiced as rigidly
as it should have been.
Nuisances when reported, were abated when it was possible to do so.
Effective ground drainage, that baneful curse of most cities was poorly at-
tained.
DISINFECTANTS
As before stated, were largely used, both before and during the prevalence
of the epidemic. Copperas was purchased by the car load and liberally
sown over the city, and left to bleach under the sun and soak into the
ground with every rain-fall. Gutters, privies, cess-pools and back-yards
were similarly treated. Sulphur fumed in almost every house, and night
seemed infernal when the combustion became general throughout the
Streets.
At one time, after the epidemic had raged with much severity west of
Market, our principal street, the thorough and efficient use of sulphur and
copperas seemed to produce good results, so much so that but two or three
cases existed in this section. Afterwards, however, the disease gained
fresh vigor and continued with unabated fury until frost terminated the
epidemic. At no other time did disinfectants ever appear to produce any
general beneficial results.

YELLOW FEVER.
It now becomes my painful duty to chronicle an event that finds no par-
allel in the history of our prosperous city. The vulture of disease having
already bathed his beak and dipped his talons in the best blood of our
sunny Southern land, scented his prey as it sought refuge in the midst of
our mountains, and early in the sombre days of September, 1878, flapped
his lazy wings over our hitherto healthful homes. Our first imported case
came from Memphis, and died here the 21st of August, after a week's ill-
ness. At that time and previously we received daily, large numbers of
refugees from fever-stricken cities. Our doors, public and private, stood
fearlessly ajar for the reception of guests, such was our confidence in our
elevation and situation to afford immunity from contamination. In this
we were disappointed. Many brought their personal effects and belong-
ings, even in some instances, including household goods and chattels,
brought from wrecks of the already partially death-dealt families.
Another important case, Wm. Griffin, by name, came from Memphis
and died here the 6th of September, after nearly a week's illness. This
case died some distance from the first. No other refugees died until af-
ter deaths had occurred among our own citizens.
A link-to-link tracing of the case was made by Dr. P. D. Sims, and
presented as a report to the Yellow Fever Commission, at the meeting of
the American Public Health Association at Richmond, in 1878. As is
often the case many of these links were missing. Whether by accident.
or not, yellow fever first broke out in poorly drained and low sections of
the city, yet the imported cases happened to fall in this locality, and had
they sickened and died in other more elevated and healthful sections, I
am not prepared to say that the result would not have been the same. I
am more inclined to the belief that the germs materies morbi, animalculea,
infection, or whatever we are pleased to call it (and I believe no one knows,)
was brought in household goods, personal effects, baggage &c., than those
coming sick with the fever and dying, transmitted it from one to another,
for it generally happened that those most intimately associated with these
imported first cases as friends and nurses, escaped the fever.
Why they should have escaped and the unfortunate neighbor
two squares away, who never went near the sick one's house,
should sicken and die, with his entire household, is one of those
mysteries which seems to cling to yellow fever. Yet this unfor-
tunate neighbor is usually made a link in the chain that connects
the tangled facts that go to make the early history of an epidem-
ic. The bulk of facts warrants us in the belief that the germ of
the disease are not re-produced in the human body, but that they
are extraneous and often travelihdependently of human aid.
I believe the growing intensity of an epidemic of yellow fever
is due to the rapid reproduction of the extraneous materies morbi,
when favored by atmospheric telluric and climatic influences,

and that the increased rate of mortality is the manifestation and
not the cause of this re-production—in other words the effect is
too often mistaken for the cause. It would seem, therefore, that
yellow fever was introduced into our midst in many different
ways, constituting as we know, several focal centres, from which
the disease disseminated, and that to us one of these focal cen-
tres were all the resulting cases tracable.
Had our sanitary condition been better we might have had yel-
low fever less—had it been perfect, we might still have had yel-
low fever.
Cleanliness alone does not seem to prevent the introduction and
development of yellow fever. Filth in this as in other diseases
is a favorable producing factor.
Total non-intercourse with persons, and absolute abstinance
from contact with things from an infected locality seems to be
the only certain prevention against this direful scourge. Com-
plete "depopulation of towns and cities once infected, the only
reliable and certain remedy.
PRESENT SANITARY CONDITION.
.The city of Chattanooga at the present writing (August 1879,)
I feel warranted in saying, is in better sanitary condition than
ever before. For this we are mainly indebted to the efficient work
of a board of Sanitary Commissioners recently appointed by the
city council. Their efforts have been chiefly directed to the
cleaning of filthy gutters, drainage of cess-pools and damp places,
the removal of garbage from alleys, streets and backyards, and
the inspection and cleaning of privies. This has caused a revo-
lution in the minds of the people which will be productive of
good.
With a thorough system of sewerage, an efficient quarantine,
general internal sanitation producing a less favorable field for di-
sease, we may live in comparative security against the inroads of
yellow fever and many other death-dealing maladies.
