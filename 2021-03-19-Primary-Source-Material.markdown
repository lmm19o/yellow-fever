On August 24th, there were six cases among refugees. August 26th, L. L. Downs, a Grenada refugee, died, and the next day Miss Delia Lake died, and four others were in a critical condition. By the 1st of September the disease had become general and raged with fury, and telegrams poured over the land telling that the city of flowers had become a city of death. New Orleans, Memphis, Louisville, St. Louis, and the whole country rallied to their relief in the shape of money and all kinds of supplies. All through the hot September days came the pathetic telegrams of the heroic Holland telling the daily doings of the devastating disease. Bravely he stood till he was alone, all the original Relief Committee had died, and on October 19th, came his last dispatch as follows: “ To-day there have been six new cases and one death.

LEWES.
Post village of Sussex county, DE, 4 miles from Cape Hennepin, on Delaware Bay. The only fever here, was brought by some sailors, who put into port with a fearfully infected ship. The fourth out of a crew of eight died in awful agony, all the more terrible symptoms of black vomit, paroxysms, etc., being present, as in the most virulent fever. The captain died in even worse agony. He was buried on shore. Though the harbor is full of crafts, only a single captain went over to render assistance, the doctor and undertaker of course doing the service needed of each. The young mate, whose dead father was the captain, as well as the rest of the crew of eight men, had the fever on their voyage of eight days, and were so exhausted that they could not hoist the sails to keep them from rotting with the damp. Nobody from the shore or the neighboring vessels went near them, and they were helpless indeed. One of the owners, looking after the body of his son, who died of the fever in Cuba, and was on board in a cask of liquor, telegraphed for a tug to come and take the fever ship to New York, where she was bound.

LITTLE ROCK.
The capital of the State of Arkansas, in Pulaski county, on Arkansas river, and on the M. & L. R. railroad, F. S. & L. R. railroad, and the St. L., I. M. & S. railroad. Population, 20,000. So rigid was the quarantine, and so healthy the city, and so energetic and complete were all possible sanitary precautions, that yellow fever could not secure a foothold. A little boy, a refugee from Memphis, effected an entrance, and died at a small peanut stand, where his parents lived. This was early in September, and was the nearest to a case of yellow fever, although many reports frequently alarmed the citizens, many of whom were prepared for flight at any hour. Quarantine was established against New Orleans, August 6th, and against Memphis, August 16th. Two officers were placed on the St. L. & I. M. railroad, one at Belmont and the other at St. Louis, who were very strict, exercising much vigilance and judgment in the performance of their duty. Health officers' were also stationed at Poplar Bluff and Bismark. Over 100 Memphians were shut out of the city in one day. Many who entered on foot, by running the blockade, were driven out. A cordon of pickets surrounded the city day and night, comprising some of the best citizens. It was an iron-clad quarantine. The steamer Maumelle was stopped 12 miles below the city and ordered back to Memphis. The streets of the city were daily sprinkled with carbolic acid in lieu of water, streets, sewers, and alleys were thoroughly cleansed, lime and copperas scattered in great quantities, mail matter fumigated before allowed to enter the city; the board of health met every day, and we do not think a quarantine was ever more rigidly enforced, or a board of health ever labored more earnestly and energetically. They declared they had no yellow fever then, and that none could get in. There being great excitement, a Howard Association was formed, which raised considerable funds for the suffering people. About the 10th of September, Dr. E. T. Easley,; one of their most prominent physicians, volunteered his services, and with thirty nurses went to Memphis, where he, with twenty of the nurses, died in less than a month. She even quarantined against Louisville, Ky., on the 20th of September, but by the assurance of mayor and board of health of Louisville, was raised October 2d. The panic died out, and only in October were trains permitted to run from Memphis. Little Rock has shown the world that a real quarantine and careful cleanliness could prevent the march of yellow fever.

MCNAIRY.
The name of a plantation 6 miles from Dry Grove, MS Fever appeared here early in October, and raged most violently, very few escaped. In one house, that of Mr. McNair, there were 17 cases, himself and wife, two married daughters and their husbands and children, a married son, his wife and children, with other family connections, all crowded together into one country house. Truly it was a pitiable sight. Many were in a very critical condition, while several were suffering the pains consequent upon the initiatory stages of the disease, and the groans of some, mingled with prayers of others, and the closely-packed apartments, the noise and confusion, and the constant moving to and fro of nurses, visitors and friends, served to remind us more forcibly of a hastily-constructed hospital to receive the wounded after a battle than any scene we have ever witnessed. Within a hundred yards of this house were eight more cases, while within a radius of two miles there were forty cases. Dr. F. Quijano, the great Spanish physician, came and helped them through the terrible trial. Total cases, 36; total deaths, 9. Date of last death, November 6th. Total expenses, $417.50.

Martin, was taken ill at her hotel September 2d, and died September 4th.

One after another three telegraph operators were stricken down, also the postmaster, express agent and depot agent were taken down, and all business was done by the agent at Gardner's station. Dr. Julius Wise came from Memphis. Doctors, nurses and supplies rushed in upon the town from many friends.

MEMPHIS.
County seat of Shelby county, TN, the largest city in the State, located on the Mississippi river, is the terminus of five important railroads, and is surrounded by a rich, fertile, cotton-growing country. Population, 56,000. As the great Father of Waters glides swiftly toward the Gulf, the warmhearted, whole-souled denizens of Memphis, from an elevated wave-wrapped bluff, proudly gaze upon the surrounding grandeur of peace and plenty. But within, the quiet bosom is disturbed by the turbid waves of the filthy, and polluted, Bayou Gayoso, dealing death and destruction while it flows, onward and northward to empty. its cess-pools of corruption. into the Mississippi above the city. During summer it ceases: to flow, becoming the natural receptacle of sewers, sinks, vaults, and all manner, of disease-breeding materials, which, being exposed to the rays of a burning sun, generate miasm throughout its meanderings. That great arch-humbug, the Nicholson pavement, with miles of decayed and decaying vegetable matter, saturated with the percolation of every species of animal and vegetable accumulations, reeking with pestilential germs held in abeyance until fully death-armed. with kindred cohorts from other points, fell with maddened, fevered fury upon the heads of the people. Fifty-six thousand souls are peacefully enjoying midnight slumbers. The. white-winged messenger of death is on the march. The Macedonian cry is flashed from the lofty hills of Vicksburg, and wired from peaceful and quiet Grenada. With bated breath and palpitating heart, the perilous words are caught in their winged approach. “Put your house in order! put the city in a thorough sanitary condition!” was the cry. The most rigid quarantine was advocated early in July by that great hero, Dr. R. W. Mitchell. His views being rejected by the municipal authorities, he resigned. On the 27th of July, the steamer John D. Porter from New Orleans, with several cases of fever on board, was prohibited from landing, the authorities having been notified by telegram from Vicksburg. She continued up stream, her crew suffering and dying en route, until decimated and disbanded at Gallipolis, Ohio, where much consternation and several deaths occurred. A few days after this the steamer Golden Crown, with several cases of fever on board, was not permitted to land. Two members of Pat Winters' family were passengers on this boat, and it is said that above Memphis, a boat from St. Louis was met and they were transferred, and in some manner were smuggled into Memphis, scattering the infection from one locality, to be mentioned hereafter. July 30, 1878, the Board of Health established a quarantine station on President's Island, a few miles below the city, with Dr. A. Lawrence, quarantine officer. August 1st, all articles by express from infected points, except money, mails and personal apparel, were prohibited. On the same day a sick man, William Warne, a stranger, applied to Dr. Brown, and was admitted to the hospital Friday, August 2d. Late that afternoon Dr. Thornton, the hospital physician, reported to Dr. John H. Erskine, of the Board of Health, that he thought it was a case of yellow fever. This case resulted in death Saturday, August 3d. The second case was reported August 4. Friday, August 9th, Mrs. Kate Bionda, who lived at No. 212 Front street, was taken sick. She died Tuesday, August 13th, rat 11 o'clock A. M., and was buried at 4 P. M. on the same day. This was recognized by many as the first case that occurred in Memphis. She and her husband kept an eating or snackhouse, frequently patronized by river laborers. They cleaned and cooked fish, meats, etc., depositing all filth and slops in close proximity to the house, and slept in a back room directly over the eating and cook room. The Board of Health gave it as their opinion that she contracted the disease from some guest who had come up the river from the infected South. The premises and surroundings were immediately taken charge of by the health officer, all avenues of egress barricaded and guarded, the entire neighborhood thoroughly disinfected and all possible precautions used. James McConnell, a policeman, who died on Poplar street about this time, is claimed by some as having been the first case, although investigations have not yet decided. On the 13th of August the Board of Health officially announced the first case of yellow fever as follows:“ MEMPHIS, August 13, 1878.-Mrs. Kate Bionda, at 212 Front Row, is undoubtedly a case of yellow fever.“D. D. SAUNDERS, M. D., President Board of Health.. John H. ERSKINE, M. D., Health Officer.” On the same day the Howard Association was reorganized as follows: A. D. Langstaff, Vice-President, presiding, with the following members attending : A. E. Frankland, A. M. Stoddard, J. H. Edmondson, E. B. Foster, F. F. Bowen, E. J. Mansford, J. H. Smith, J. G. Lonsdale, Sr., F. W. Holt, W. J. B. Lonsdale, J. J. Murphy. Dr. Saupe was called to see William Leonard, 1631 Poplar street, on the same day, with symptoms of yellow fever. Two other suspicious cases in the same locality were reported by Dr. Ess. On August 14th Prof. Theodore Decker, No. 34 Alabama street, organist of St. Mary's Catholic church, was reported by Dr. Willett as having died of yellow fever that morning. Prof. Decker occupied one-half of the building, No. 34, while P. M. Winters occupied the other half with his family. The latter are those who were passengers on the Golden Crown and were smuggled into the city, remaining two or three days before being discovered and driven away. On the 14th of August the citizens made a general stampede from the city, and the hegira continued until forty thousand people fled from their homes in search of more congenial climes. One railroad agent sold $35,000 worth of tickets in three days. The terrible scenes, sufferings and deaths during the prevalence of the epidemic form a sad history. Ripe manhood, youth and beauty, high and low, were alike cut down by the fell destroyer. Of those who remained it is estimated that ninety per cent. were stricken down, and over four thousand died. In that section of the city first attacked, ninety-nine per cent. of those who remained were taken down. Whitewinged frost at last demanded the monster's disappearance.

Young Howlett, aged 10 years, grandson of Mr. Pledge, the hotel man of Grand Junction, passed up to Milan, where his grandfather was staying. Being from an infected town, although only having staid in it a few hours, he could not remain in Milan. His grandfather, therefore, rented an isolated cabin some mile or more from town, and hired a negro woman to take the boy and stay with him until the days of his quarantine were completed. The first night the poor boy attempted to stay in the cabin was a terrible one in his experience. A few persons, whom fear and cowardice had made brutes, went to the cabin at night, brickbatted it, shot into it, and ran the poor little boy out into the night and darkness, and fired shot after shot at him as he fled in wild terror. The little fellow, frightened almost out of his life, remained all night in the woods, wandering and hiding in terror, shivering in the pitiless cold, and almost crazed with a sense of loneliness and danger, and expecting every moment to be murdered. Next morning he crept into Milan, and his grandfather took the terrified child to a place of safety.

NEW ORLEANS.
County seat of Orleans county, La., and capital of the State. Population, 239,378. Is the largest city in the State and ninth in size in the United States, is located on Mississippi river 110 miles from its mouth, is a great railroad center, the great commercial emporium of the South, and largest cotton market in the world. Steamboats go regularly from New Orleans to every point on the Mississippi river and its tributaries. On the 23d day of May, 1878, the ship Emily B. Souder arrived at quarantine below New Orleans, having called in at Havana during her trip. Upon her arrival, Dr. Carrington, the quarantine officer, after making an examination, telegraphed Dr. Choppin, President of Board of Health, as follows: “The Souder has a case of intermittent on board. What shall I do ?” Dr. Choppin replied: “Fumigate and disinfect the ship, and satisfy yourself of the character of the disease,'before you let her up.” The sick man was placed in quarantine hospital and finally recovered. The Souder, after five hours detention, and disinfected with sulphur burned in pans, was permitted to go up to the city. Soon after arrival in the city Mr. Clark, the purser, was taken ill, and Dr. Drew, of Pilot Town, who had taken passage at that point, was called to treat the case. The physician did not consider this a case of yellow fever, as he signed the certificate of death, “intermittent fever.” This case was not reported to the Board of Health. Mr. Elliott, the second engineer of the Souder, was taken sick, and after a day or two was removed to the Hotel Dieu, where he soon died. After death this case was reported to the Board of Health, and Dr. Choppin and others made a post-mortem examination, and gave their views that the case was yellow fever. Here was a ship which touched at an infected port, had three cases of sickness, two of whom died, and one case pronounced yellow fever, and yet some contend that the germ was not brought to New Orleans by the ship. Evidently the “ovæ” had been deposited, but at that time " climatic conditions” did not favor rapid reproduction. Dr. Wm. G. Austen, after giving the case much investigation, writes: “I am of the opinion that the ship brought the fever to our city.” For nearly two months after this, if fever existed in the city, it was of such a mild nature as not to attract attention. The germs or “sporules ” may have been quietly awaiting for the proper “climatic” influences before being developed, or there may have been other avenues of ingress during the two months. It is stated that some of the fish dealers, having had their clearance papers made out from an uninfected port, afterwards touched at an infected port, and in this way came to the city and spread the fever. About the same time the schooner Wilhelmina, from Galveston, ran the blockade at the Rigoletts without receiving a permit from the quarantine authorities at the station. The President of the Board was notified, and the sheriff seized the vessel and carried her back to quarantine. This vessel had two sick persons on board who were taken to Charity Hospital. Both of these cases died of fever. On the 21st of May, 1878, the steamship Borassia, from Liverpool, touched at Havana and arrived at Mississippi quarantine station with yellow fever on board, five cases of whom were transferred to the quarantine hospital, three of whom died. She was detained eleven days and was fumigated with sulphur before being allowed to pass ap to the city. The smoldering germs of yellow fever remained apparently dormant during June, and no other cases were reported at the hospital until July 28th. On that day the schooner F. L. Richardson, from Matanzas, arrived with a crew of eight men, two cases of fever and one death. In 1873, the first case was traced to the bark Valparaiso, which reached New Orleans on the 26th of June, in the person of Jose Maria Arna, the mate. Dr. Jos. Jones reports that the first case, after the Souder cases that came under his notice, was one which occurred on Constance street, June 30th. The disease commenced to develop in various portions of the city about this time, not confining itself to the low and filthy portions, but some of the healthiest and most cleanly streets presenting cases. On the 24th of July, the following communication was sent:
