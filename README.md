# yellow-fever :mosquito: 

My long term goal for this project is to consider the ways religious communities were impacted by the outbreaks of yellow fever in 1878 and 1879. They were both shaped by the epidemic itself, as well as able to determine the direction of some of the relief efforts. This semester I have been focusing on the locations experiecing the worst of the scourge as well as determining who responded to the crisis in those locales. My conclusions thus far point to Memphis as the site for greatest future potential investigation.
