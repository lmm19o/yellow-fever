TO THE FKIENDS OF SANITARY PROGRESS IN TENNESSEE Two years ago the State Board of Healt determined to publish a Monthly Bulletin a a -medium of communication between itself,
the general public, and the various Count and Local Boards of Health. Just at thi time the Bureau of Agriculture discontinue its connection with the State Weather Service,
an offshoot of its. own. A strong apneal wa made to the State Board of Health to tak charge of this important public work in con-
nection with its own climatological work This appeal was heeded. For the past tw years the Bulletin lias been devoted to the
.Meteorology of the State, as well as to offi-
cial sanitary notes Very large editions of special numbers wer issued, and systematically distributed in ever nook and corner of Tennessee, at heavy ex-
pense for printing and postage. It was hope that the General Assembly of 1887 would se the necessity of increasing the appropriatio for the Board so as to meet this heavy expend-
iture for printing and circulating informatio among the people; but although climatolog is becoming a pressing topic for State ai throughout the Union, this appropriation wa withheld The Board, however, is unwilling to discon-
tinue a journal which is gathering up and pre-
serving records of climate and disease perma-
nently valuable to investigators at home an abroad, and which consequently has met wit high favor from all such Hence, with the beginning of the third vol-
ume a small subscription is asked, which wil barely meet the expense of printing. Ou friends in Tennessee are requested to get u lists for us without delay Proceedings of the Quarterly Meeting o the Board, July 5, 1887 Eleven A. M.—The Board met according t law. Present: J. M. Safford, Acting Presi-
dent; J. D. Plunket, I). F. Wright, P. P Sims, and the Secretary, Dr. Lindsley. Ab-

Dr. J. I). Plunket, President Slate Board Health:
Sir—For the three months ending June 30t the Monthly Bulletin has given members of this
Board, and also a large circle of readers in ever part of Tennessee, as full information concernin sickness and mortality as it is possible to get with-
out laws for obtaining vital statistics. A griev-
ous disappointment it is to all interested in prac-
tical sanitary work, that this great and advancing
State o£ Tennessee should be so notoriously lie-

hind in one of the main characteristics of a civil-
ized people. For two years more, however, w must stumble along as best we can in a twiligh furnished mainly by voluntary :uid public spirite observers In the meantime, while waiting for details,
without which accurate science is impossible,  great field of practical work is open to Tennesse sanitarians Our'two millions of people are in a measur unprotected against one of the most hideous pest to which the human race is liable. Should smail-
[>ox orce fairly get a hold in Tennessee its rav-
ages would be fearful. The prophylaxis is wel established by the experience of European nation luring more than a century. Jt is strange tha the public and the medical profession are so stu-
pidly indifferent to this constantly impending peril One great cause of long-continued illness, o slow recovery, and of unnecessary mortality, is th foul air breathed, to a greater or less extent, by al who dwell in our cities and towns. Surface filil pollutes the atmosphere in all Tennessee cities,
towns and villages to an extent not imagined b our physicians and citizens. The streets, alleys,
and back-yards, even in our most thoroughl awake communities, are far from being cleaned u as systematically and frequently as should be th case. Health officers everywhere find this th great stumbling-block in their way. Our peopl and their servants, the public officials, must b aroused from their fatal lethargy. Filthy soi means polluted water and foul air. Filthy soi signifies the long train of ills which result fro polluted water and foul air The climate and the soil of Tennessee are the tw inestimable treasures bestowed upon us by a benef-
icent Providence. A shame it is that in a mag-
nificent region, dotted over with universities, col-
leges and academies, two such blessings should b nullified by ignorance and laziness!
In Tennessee, as everywhere else, the great figh must be against filth. This fight has hardly com-
menced. We may hope for more rapid progres in the near future, as the pioneer efforts of this
Board and its auxiliaries are now bearing marke results The following additions have been made to th library during the last quarter:

Obion, Dyer, Lauderdale, Tipton and
Shelby counties; their Goneral Fea-
tures and Sanitary Relations.
BY J. M. SAFFORD, M. D. Chairman of the Committee on Water Supply.
[Continuedfrom last month.]
In presenting in more detail the relations o the Loess and Orange Sand to the counties in
Tennessee in which it is found, one cannot d better perhaps than to follow up the geolog of the line of the Chesapeake aud Ohio rail-
road, running as it does, length wise from nort to south, quite through the entire belt an wholly within the area of the two formations It will bo recollected, we note parenthetically,
that we have to do with the uplands, so tha bottom areas are excluded The railroad in leaving Kentucky first en-
ters Obion county, Obion may be taken a typical of the Loess belt of counties, in whic are included, we may repeat, besides Obion Dyer, Lauderdale, Tipton and Shelby. Obio is the freshest of them all, and perhaps bette represents the others in their condition before,
the cultivation of cotton had taxed their re-
sources so heavily. It was farther away fro the center of destructive cotton culture i slavery times; its soils, in general, have no been so overworked; old and thrown outfield are not as often met with; it had more fores to clear up for new land ; its people have bee enterprising, and now the county stands in th forefront, active and prosperous. It is a won-
derful area. No county in the State wit such giant timber—whole houses in a singl log, trees with dimensions so great that th report of tliem staggers belief In speaking thus of Obion, however, I d not intend to disparage the other counties In general features they are like Obion, an are in the same category. In some respect they have the advantage. Most of them, a an example, can boast a greater area of leve or favorably rolling uplands, for parts of
Obion are exceedingly rough and hilly Their worn soils have generally strong under-
soils, and can be restored, and many hav been. The restoration is nearly always practi-
cable where washes and gullies have not bee permitted to grow and grievously mar the sur-
face and thus ruin the land. These countie have, too, a fair quota of new- and fresh lan of great and generous fertility. At any rate,
take them as they are and considering thei uplands alone, they will not suffer in contras with any group of counties of the same num-
ber in the State. Their soils are based upo the Loess, and this holds all the fundamenta requisites of a strong fertility Nearly all the cuts excavated for the bed o the Chesapeake road, from the Kentucky lin to Memphis, are iu the Loess, and many o them give sections of special interest. Th first we mention, however, is on another road,
the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis. It i about the fourth of a utile west of Paducah
Junction, the point where the two roads cross It is a long cut through a low dividing ridge,
and shows at its deepest part the followin section of the formations:
1. Soils, resting directly on the Loess, ther being no appeareuee of the Yellow Clay
Loam.
2. Loess, well characterized, 6 feet thick At the bottom shows transition into th formation below.
3. Orange Sand or Drift, G feet exposed,
mostly coarse, compact sand, a littl clayey; yellowish gray with trace of re in upper part; orange below: grains o sand rounded; a few quartz pebbles o the size of peas in the lower part The summit passed here is the highes point on the road between the Junction aud

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Union City. The Orange Sand appears at th bottom and middle of the cut, and, with  broadly rounded upper surface, presents itsel as the longitudinal axis or core of the ridge,
with the layers of Loess and soils resting lik inverted shallow troughs upon it. The Loes here has but little thickness, pointing to th fact that the Junction is not far from th feather edge or eastern limit of the formation Going westerly its thickness notably increases,
as is seen at Union City, and especially about
Troy, the county-scatof Obion, in the neighbor-
hood of which it ranges from 100 to 200 feet The fact that wells, sunk into the Loess at
Union City and Troy, supply hard limeston water, has already been referred to and th reason for it given. A word here further a to Troy. The town has a pleasing location o high ground. The formation underlying it is
Loess, and the cuts about the place affor good opportunities for the study of the charac-
teristics of this earthy and remarkable deposit The gravel and Rand of the Drift or Orange
Sand formation, which lie next below the
Loess, were not seen in the lowest places o the branches, though their horizon must b nearly reached. On the road to Union City,
at a point within two miles of Troy, a small
.stream flowing between high hills has cut it way down through the Loess into the grave and sand, and, indeed, through these to th top of the Lignitic Group. At no other poin on the Union City road has this occurred, so fa as I have seen. The formation is Loess all th way. The high hills, just referred to are ver steep, and present the formation in great force One mile from Troy on the Dyersburg road,
immediately after crossing Mill Creek, on ascends a formidable hill known as Faulk's
Hill. On this there is a wonderful presenta-
tion of the Drift gravel. It is the be of the road from the creek to nearly the to of the hill. The presence of this grave appears to be due to a great uplift of th formations, resulting from a faulting an displacement of the strata, though the com-
paratively enormous volume of gravel ma point to a different explanation. How it ha occurred is a problem to be solved. But b this as it may, the quantity of the materia exposed is truly extraordinary.
VVe now pass back to the Chesapeake roa and persue our course toward Memphis From Faducah Junction through Rives and
Newbern on to Dyersburg, all the railroa cuts are in the Loess, some of them exposin instructive sections. No Orange Sand wa observed in any of them Rive* is in Obion county, and has impor-
tance for the reason that at this point the
Chesapeake'.road (the C, O. & S. W. railroad)
is crossed by the Mobile & Ohio road. It is  thriving business point, located just outsid and west of the part of the bottom of the
Obion river subject to overflow. It may b said to be in the second bottom of the river,  very fertile and level area, running back fro the town nearly a mile to a line of slopin hills. These hills begin the uplands o table-lands, which extend with more or les continuity far west to the vicinity of Reelfoo lake. They are made up of Loess, and are o easy access from Rives for observation an study Newbern.. This active business place is o the railroad in Dyer county, nearly nine mile northeast from Dyersburg, the county-seat It is located in an elevated and rolling belt o country between the Obion and North Forked
Deer rivers. For ten miles in every directio around Newbern, the country is rich an thickly populated. One is never out of sigh of a house. It is asserted that this area pro-
duces more than any equal area in the State,
the products being chiefly corn, cotton, to-
bacco and wheat. The uplands are based o the fine material of the Loess, and is a goo example of the lands this formation gives u when the surface has a favorable topograph and lies well. The railroad cuts and expos-
ures in the vicinity of the town all show th earthy material of the Loess. The gravel an sands of the Orange Sand formation are no seen. These in the town itself are reached i digging wells at a depth of 60 or 80 feet,

HEALTH Iff TENNESSEE Extraot of Reports of Health Officer? and Official Corres-
pondents to the State Board of Health
The reports of our correspondents, wh though for the most part health officials, ye are so poorly paid as to be virtually voluntee observers, for the month of July, while brief,
are still full of interest. The connection o climate with disease is plainly evident. Th general good health of Tennessee equally so The field for investigating the causes of dis-
ease, and consequent means for their preven-
tion is wide and open. Consumption ough not to figure so largely as it does, in a clime s favorable to open houses and out door life a that of Tennessee. The mortality of the
African race in all our cities and towns is  huge outcry and reproach to authority some-
where. Steps should be taken to diminish i without delay The principal diseases named in the orde of their greater prevalence in the State for th month of July, were Malarial Fever, Typhoid
Fever, Cholera Infantum, Dysentery, Diar-
rhea, Consumption, Cholera Morbus, Pneu-
monia, and Rheumatism.

BHPOBT FOB JITX."^, 1887 The Oiinitt «f Jury presented the astta amount of electrical disturbances, but tVe
^principal t'eatwre was tbe excessive ami an-
preceaeated heat during tie latter halt of th month The mean temperature was 78° 8, consider-
ably :iKn\<- the normal, and the highest mea for many years. The maximum temperature
-was 181 recorded on three different days; th minimum was 56° recorded on the 1st, and
-was the highest July minimum since 1883 The hot wave which came about the Kith,
■culminated generally about the 17th-19th,
-but continued with a slight relaxation until
•the close of the month, and was the longest
■warm spell ever known. The ranges of tem-
perature were about the normal The precipitation was rather below th average, the mean being 3.32 inches; of thi amount, the Eastern division received a average of about four inches, and the othe two divisions about three inches. The great
•est monthly rainfall was 5.67 inches, reporte at Grief!, iu lower East Tennessee, and th least rainfall was only 0.80 inch, reported at
Woodstock, in the extreme southwestern por-
tion of the State. The greatest local dail rainfall was 2.13 inches, reported at Florence
Station, on the 24th. The days of greates rainfall were the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 21st, 24th,
the last showing the greatest daily fall. Mos of the rains were very light and local i character. It is worthy of remark that wit such a small average precipitation, there wa only one day during the month—the 15th—on
•which rain was not reported at one or mor stations in the State, yet the table show many rainless intervals; the week of the
14th-20th, was the "dry week," and wit the exception of a few local rains in East
Tennessee, and two or three in the wester part of the State, there was a serious absenc of precipitation. It was during this perio that the hot wave culminated and was s severely felt. Many of the rains were at-
tended with severe electric storms, some o which were very destructive to life and prop-
erty. The proportion of cloudiness was abou the normal The percentage of verification of the tem-
perature and weather predictions during th month at Fayetteville and Clarksville, wer as follows: Fayetteville, temperature 100.

A number o these springs have locally quite a high thera-

SPECIAL REPORT Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, August 21, 1887-
Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Boar of Health—Sir: Carrying out the direction of the Executive Committee, given yesterday,
as follows, have visited Tullahoma:
"1. Investigating the rumored outbreak o scarlet fever at that point, noting details, wit number of cases and deaths to date."
It seems that the first case occurred som six weeks ago, a child aged 3 years, who wit its mother had just returned from Nashville,
having visited relatives there The next two cases occurred in a famil intimate with the above These three cases are the only ones amon the citizens proper. Of a very mild form, an ready recovery The other cases were in the group of con-
solidated hotels, to-wit: Two cases in th family of a gentleman from Nashville, whic occupied a cottage on the hotel ground. De-
veloped soon after arriving in Tullahoma; on now well and the other recovering. And on case, now well and gone home, in a famil which occupied a room in the main building,
and no doubt had intercourse with the famil above-mentioned. And five cases in a famil from Nashville, occupying a cottage on hote grounds. Of these one is now well, two ar convalescing, one still ill, (the only case a present) and one died j a little boy about nin years old, originally of a very delicate consti-
tution. There seems to be no doubt that th children of this family had communicated wit the other family from Nashville where the tw cases prevailed, although the cottages were o different squares The said two cases may have got the infec-
tion in Nashville, or may have caught it fro either of the town families, both at no grea distance from the hotels The physicians in attendance and othe parties agree in representing the disease as o a very mild form. Of the total eleven case one was fatal.
"2. Upon arriving there at once secure  conference with the city officials, and also wit leading citizens, and urge upon them the im-
portance of establishing a Board of Health an enacting proper laws to make it effective."

  p. 14 (#20)                        14
STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
"Also urge the enactment of laws, (a.) whic will hereafter require, under penalty, the re-
porting of each and every case of contagiou and infectious disease that may occur withi the corporate limits. (l>.) The obtaining o burial permits in every case before interment,
and the reporting to this board each month th accurate mortality statistics of Tullahoma."
The authorities of Tullahoma had alread begun action as to a local board. The act t establish it needs but one more reading There can be no doubt that the above sug-
gestions will be fully carried out.
"3. Inspect the general sanitary condition o the town, its water supply, and the existin privy system.'' As to the privy system, it i surface, with buckets or Doxes. frequentl emptied. The hotels use lime freely, an employ scavengers to empty the vessels dail or oi'tener if needed The water supply is abundant, clear and cool,
from deep wells, of which there are many There is also a magnificent and copious sprin of freestone water The general sanitary condition of the tow is unquestionably good. The people, except i a small business area, are scattered about i neat and handsome houses, occupying muc room. For years they have recognized th importance of cleanliness Of course, while depending upon wells an springs for water, it is of prime necessity tha the surface through which drainage may ente these wells should be absolutely free fro night soil, garbage or filth of any descriptio whatever. As the town has now a population,
permanent and floating, of quite 4,000 souls,
this will be impossible without the rigid en-
forcement of stringent laws From the details given under the first hea some interesting conclusions are clear Itis evident that all parties were misled by th lightness of the cases into a neglect of warnin the public and strictly isolating the patients Had these two cardinal axioms of sanitar practice been carried out at the start, there i every reason for believing that the diseas would have been confined to the first cas enumerated above, as far as the citizens wer concerned, and to the one family at the hotel,
three cases in all, instead of eleven, with a death.
A live board of health, clothed with du authority, would have seen to this. Unneces-
sary alarm and panic would have been averte and much damage prevented With so little precaution against the sprea of the disease, and the town crowded wit children, it certainly speaks well for the salu-
brity of the climate that it was confined to s few houses, was of such mild character, and i now disappearing entirely under proper iso-
lation and disenfection. In the last ninetee years scarlet fever has occurred three times in
Tullahoma, in each instance imported All of which is respectfullv submitted bv

tum and an occasional cafe of cholera morbus;
and also a few cases of fever—typhoid and ma-
larial. During the month of August the bowe affections were observed less frequently and th fever much more frequently. These latter pre-
vailed almost entirely in the country, the tow being entirely healthy. The character of th fevers that prevailed in August, or the latter par of the summer, seemed to me to be a littl anomalous for this country. Neither typhoid no malarial as described in the books generally, no a blending of the two, as described by som authors. The outset of the fever was gradual,
but when once fully developed, the temperatur was us high as it ever became during the progres of the disease It was continuous, although wit marked lowering of the temperature in the morn-
ings. There were few or none of the nervou symptoms generally seen in typhoid fever, neithe were there nausea and vomiting, as usual in ma-
larial fevers, nor were there diarrhea, gurglin nor distension, as seen in typhoid fever. On th contrary, constipation was the rule. I saw n rose-colored spots. Toward the close of the dis-
ease profuse perspirations were frequent; thes were sometimes exhausting. The disease gener-
ally lasttd about three weeks—sometimes longer Quinine was the principal remedy used. Whe given I reel v this nearly always lessened the feve very much, hut ih ver stopped it entirely Gibson county—Dr T. J. Happel, County

ported; and a considerable prevalence, just at th close of the month, of pharyngitis, catarrhs an diseases of that ilk, due to a cool wave, followin the " dog-days." Our prevalent ailments, how-
ever, are continued fevers—some typhoid, an considerable malarial fever, but not so widesprea as during the two preceding months. The sum-
mer has been marked by a greater prevalence o febrile diseases than usual, but with a remarkabl insignificant degree of mortality, though of cours some deaths have occurred. The increase o fevers is variously attributed to a partially ne source of water supply, to a more than usuall rank growth of vegetation, a remarkably hot sum-
mer, bad drainage, vast amount of excavating fo new buildings and sewers, and other causes Whooping-cough iB also with us in the city, an one or two cases of alleged diphtheria have bee reported. With these exceptions the health o the city is excellent, and, as before stated, eve the prevalent diseases show a steady decrease o late Hancock county—Dr. Wm. P. Mahan, County
Health Officer.—No report received Hardeman county—Dr. Jas. J. Neely, Jr.,
County Health Officer.—The month of Augus was exceptionally healthy; not as much sick-
ness of a malarial origin as the month before Colds and catarrhal fevers are prevailing almos epidemically, seeming to depend on some mor-
bific agent in the atmosphere. An excess of hea and dryness like an excess of moisture has checke the malarial type of fevers Hardin county—Dr. J. K. Barlow, County
Health Officer.—During August we had som few cases of whooping-cough and diphtheria an considerable malarial ailments; more sicknes than we have had for several months and wit greater fatality. Health generally is much bette at present; still some whooping-cough in differen parts of the county. Some cholera infantum, bu less than previous months Hawkins county—Dr. R. P. Mitchell, County

Health Officer.—During the past two months w have had an increase in sickness in this county For the month of July there was a great deal o bowel troubles. In the eastern part of the count it was in many cases fatal. In that part of th county it was in the form of flux. They los as well as I can learn, about 30 cases during th six weeks or two months that the epidemic lasted About the middle of August, the bowel trouble passed away, and there is now, in the east, mid-
dle and west part of the county, a very marke tendency to fevers, principally malarial, wit here and there a case of typhoid. I think th present increase of sickness, over what we gener-
ally have at this season of the year, is due to th continued dry weather. The branches, and es-
pecially the ponds (of which there are many i this counly), have nearly all dried up. Th waler used in many parts of the county is of  very bad qua lily; not only bod to the taste, bu muddy in appearance
Ear Boxing Science publishes some valuable record collected by Dr. Samuel Sexton on the ob-
served effects of boxing the ears. Dr. Sexto has fifty-one cases upon his records in whic the ear has been injured by blows of th open hatid or fist. The nature of the injurie varied considerably. One had inflammation o the ear, with suspicion of intracranial trouble,
and a running of the ear for twelve years fol-
lowing a blow ii])on that organ. This patien subsequently died of brain disease, in an-
other case the ear became inflamed and th hearing very much impaired. In anothe case the patient was slapped by his fathe upon the left ear and immediate pain an deafness ensued, with a bloody discharge,
from which he was three months in recover-
ing The dangers to which Dr. Sexton calls at-
tention are so grave that parents and all other should choose some other method of punish-
ing their children than boxing the ears. It i not improbable that, if Dr. Sexton pursue his inquiries further, he will find other case in which brain disease has followed this bar-
barous practice.—Ex The Upland Geological Formations of

[Continuedfrom lust month.]
From NewLern to Dyersburg the railroa excavations are made as heretofore in th prevailing formations of the country, the
Loess. Approaching Dyersburg, several in-
structive cuts are passed through Dji< rsburg, t he county-seat of Dyer( is lo-
cated on the north bank of the North forked
Deer river. It is an enterprising, attractiv town, built on high ground; has a commendabl quota of churches, schools, mills and mercan-
tile establishments, and is the center of  fertile and well-settled section of the county.
A substantial and handsome iron bridge span the river, connecting with a trestle and "levee"
which cross the wide bottom opposite th town. In favorable stages of the river steam-
boats ply between the place and the Mississ-
ippi, tints supplying water navigation Dyersburg is one of the points at which the
Forked Deer, in its meanders through it great bottoms, strikes the uplands. The bluf thus formed is the foot of a slope which de-
scends gradually from the highlands back o the town, and upon which the town itself i built. The superior formation is everywhere
Loess. Underlying this at the lowest levels,
as for example, at the base of the bluff, and i a deep ravine made by a branch runnin through the eastern portion of the town, out-
crops of the sands of the Drift or Orange
Sand arc seen. The formation rises as we go

  p. 19 (#25)                        STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Il back from the river. At the base of the bluf the outcrop shows a thickness of six feet frou the low water line up. Ascending the ravine,
a half or three-fourths of a utile from th river, a bold and characteristic outcrop of the
Drift is exjiosed. Tt is here twenty feet thick,
and the sands are largely dug into and use for building purposes. It is known as th sand-bank. The section is as follows:
1. Loess, at top, from 40 to 50 feet thick Orange Sand, Drift.
(a.) Sand, orange colored, with some clay,
often in a compact, hard layer, six feet.
(I.) Loose Orange Sand with white sand i irregular vein-like masses and pockets,
resting on deep yellow sand, eight feet,
(c. ) Part not exposed, dowu to branch, fiv feet No gravel is seen in this bank, but abou one hundred yards below, on the same branc and just above it, is a conspicuous bod o gravel mixed with sand, which is eight fee thick. The junction of the two formations,
the Loess and the Drift, can be satisfactoril studied in this ravine The position of the underlying Orange San at Dyersburg ought to establish a good under-
surface drainage for the town. Water an sewage sinking through the more or less per-
vious Loess, are received by the sands an carried off at their outcrops; and, on th other baud, for this very reason, the spring which issue from this horizon of sands ough to be guarded against. They may become con-
taminated and rendered unfit for drinking pur-
poses, especially if the water they discharg comes from under a thickly populated portio of the town. Many of the citizens use cister water, mostly, however, I believe, becaus wells in the Loess supply hard water From Dyersburg to Kipley, the county-sea of Lauderdale, the bed of the railroad, out-
side of the bottoms, lies all the way—with th exception of a single break—on the earthy
Loess. So it appears, at least, to one travel-
ing the road. Out after cut displays th yellowish gray and ashen material of thi formation. The exception occurs at a saw-
mill station six miles north of Ripley, named
"Curve"—so named because the road, imme-
diately south of the station, makes a note curve in passing through a prominent ridge This ridge is the "divide" between the water of South Forked Deer River and Cane Creek The curve lies in a deep cut, in which th formations are well exhibited. Conspicuou in the lower part is the Orange Sand, show-
ing here much gravel mixed with sands Pebbles of unusual size, some as large a goose eggs and larger, are seen. Resting o this is the horizontal bed of Loess, rising u in threatning walls above one's head. Th formations are first observed back at th station, before entering the cut Ripley, the county-seat of Lauderdale,  prosporous town, noted for its higher educa-
tional advantages and the intelligence of it l>eople, is "a city set upon a hill." Buil upon an elevated ridge, or high belt of table-
land, the water-shed between Cane Creek o the north and Hatchie River on the south, i can, of all the towns in Tennessee along the
Chesapeake, Ohio A Southwestern Road, boas the greatest altitude and doubtless the pures air. On the east side of the town the belt o table land on which it is, contracts to a nar-
row neck or ridge. Through this the railroa passes in a fearful excavation or cut fifty fee deep, and with nearly perpendicular walls From the level of the higher and mor removed portions of the town it is sixty an seventy feet to the bed of the road. A bridg high in air spans the chasm, allowing ingres and egress for the population, without fear o accidents from moving trains.*
The two formations—the Loess and the
Orange Sand—are grandly exposed in th great walls of the cut. The locality is oue o special interest, and traveling geologists wil find it a good point for the study of thes quaternary formations. The section in th deepest part of the cut, under and just nort of the bridge, is as follows:
1. .SoiV* and Uocm, in the slopes from the highe level to the bridge 10 feet.
2. Lttfs*, well characterised from bridge down . 20 feet.
3. Aoeaa, a shade darker than above; its lowe part containing gravel and, sparsely,
glassy grains of sand, passing into th division below 8 feet.
4. Oratiite tiand or Drift, chiefly loose snnds o orange and yellow colors, rarely white:
with occasionally in places white pip«
clay, mainly in p;iperymoro or less hoi i-
gontal seams, down t<> the road bed 20 feet The strata of the belt of highlands upo which Ripley is situated have been elevate in a great upward flexure or wave, wit its length lying approximately in an eas and west direction^ or transversely to th line of the railroad. In their presen condition the strata may be compared to  series of shallow and inverted troughs lyin in order one above another. To this remark-
able upward flexure the exceptional elevatio of the highland may be due. The railroa crosses this flexure, exposing in the deep cu the structure of the ridge. The road, afte leaving the valley of Cane Creek, in approach-
ing Ripley one mile to the south, ascend with a heavy grade, passes the summit in th cut, and then descends as rapidly, a mile an a fourth, to Batie's Creek. The strata of th formations have also their highest elevatio in the cut, and descend (or dip) each way,
north and south, even more rapidly than th railroad. So rapidly, indeed, that within les than half a mile from the summit on each side,
the Orange Sand has sunk out of sight, and the
Loess, notwithstanding the lower elevation,
is the only formation seen along the track.
[To be concluded.]
•This bridge, as T was informed, is one hundred an thirty feet above Batie's Creek a tributary of Hatchie
River, and crossed by the railroad a mile and a fourt to the south.

The features for August were the earth-
quake of the night of the 1st, and the abnor-
mally high temperature during the first au second decades. Otherwise there was bu little departure from the normal Tlie mean temperature was 76°.7, the high-
est August mean during tin? five years. Th highest temperature was 103°, recorded on the
3d, at Austin. Wilson county: and the nex highest was 102"', recorded on the 3d, 12t and 14th, at Milan, Gibson county. Th maximum, 101°, was recorded at Hiddleton Smith county, on the 15th, at Savannah, Har-
din county, on the 2d, and at Bohenwald,
Lewis county, on the 2d, 3d and 5th. Th lowest temperature was 48°, recorded on the
25th, 29th and 31st, The monthly range o temperature was slightly in excess of the nor-
mal, as was also the mean daily range. Durin the last decade a period of low temperatur prevailed The mean precipitation was 3.07 inches,
which was about an inch less than the Augus mean of last year, and about that amount mor than the August means of the two precedin years. Of this amount, the Eastern divisio received an average of three and three-fourth inches, and the Middle and Western division about two and three-fourths inches. Th rains were mostly light and local in character Those of the 5th, 15th, 17th and 26th, however,
were general, the last named being the heavi-
est fall during the month. The greates monthly rainfall was 6.43 inches, at Rogers-

ville, and the least was only 1.21 inch, at
Memphis—the smallest August rainfall at tha station, since 1872, when only 0.54 of an inc was reported. The greatest local daily rain-
fall occurred at Milan, on the 19th, when 2.96
inches fell. This was strictly a local rain, it no other observer in the Stat* reported rai on that day except at Knoxville, and tha inappreciable. The observer at Milan reports
5.10 inches of rain at his station during thre days—the 19th. 20th and 21st. Several of th rain< (that of the 26th excepted) were attende by the usual electrical disturbances. Ther were eight days on which no measurable rai fell The feature of the month was the earth-
quake on the night of the 1st, noted elsewhere,
which was felt more or less over the Stat* Dews were reported on about fifteen days The percentage of verification of weathe and temperature predictions, furnished dail from the Signal Office at Washington, to th various stations in the State during the month,

('larksville,Columbia, Murfreesboro, Gallatin,
Tullahoma, Chattanooga, Jackson, Union City,
MeMinnville, Waverly, Franklin, Nashvill and many other places in the State. It wa also felt at St. Louis, Kvansville and generall throughout southern and central Illinois,

A M., seismic disturbances were experienced;
from 1:36'.30" to IM'M" a.m., there wer fully fourteen or fifteen distinct vibrations,
shaking the office building (the Signal Servic office is in the fourth story of the Burns Block,
a large and lofty building) so perceptibly a to cause the windows and doors to rattle. Th vibrations were apparently from the sout toward the north. A low rumbling noise wa heard which sounded like cannonading at  distance. Window casings and other woo work about the building creaked, and plaster-
ing in the office fell to the floor; inkstands,
paper-weights and other articles were dis-
placed. Many persons in the city ran fro their houses in terror. The shock was mos severely felt in East Nashville.

SVB3C1UPTION, - - - 2Sc l'KR ANNUM Entered at the Postoffice at Nashville .as Second Clays
Matter On the night of September 22, the steamship
Alesia arrived below New York with six hun-
dred passengers from Marseilles and Naples Eight of her passengers died of cholera o the passage, and on her arrival at quarantin the health officers reported four cases o hoard; four others were discovered when in-
specting the passengers. The well passenger were removed the same day to Hoffman islan for observation, and the sick to Swinburne
Island Hospital. The number of cases o board on arrival was eight; twenty cases hav developed among the passengers since the have been under observation to this date; fiv of those removed from the vessel have die and three recovered. Of those that have de-
veloped while in quarantine, nine have died,
four have recovered, five arc convalescent, an the remaining two are now seriously ill. Th disease has been very virulent and nrpid in it fatality in a majority of the cases; in severa instances patients that were well at inspectio in the afternoon were nearly or quite pulseles within twelve hours. There had been no de-
velopment of cases among the immigrants u to October 5th The efficiency of the New York City and
State regulations and officials in preventin the spread of a dangerous epidemic diseas will now be fully tested. All precautions a to isolation and disinfecting seem to he thor-
oughly carried out The existence of cholera in Western Europ is a standing menace to America. For some-
thing over three years it has prevailed in vari-
ous portions of South France, Italy and Spain,
in a virulent form. Thence it found acces to Brazil and Chili last winter, doing grea damage. This is not the time to go asleep The American Public Health Association
Holds its next annual session at Memphis November 8-11. Leading sanitarians from al parts of America will take part in its proceed-
ings. A very large attendance is expecte from Tennessee and the adjoining States espe-
cially. The local committee announce reduce railroad and hotel rates. Dr. (i. 15. Thornton,

  p. 26 (#32)                        STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN President State Board of Health—Sir: Nea the close of the last quarter I sent the followin communication to the Mayors of the eighty tw principal cities and towns in Tennessee:
Dear Sir: In view of the great uneasines felt throughout the United States by the ap-
proaches of cholera, and the alarm just oc-
casioned by the few hut virulent cases of yel-
low fever at Key West, it is of the highes importance that all our cities and towns be a once placed in the best sanitary condition; o in other words be thoroughly cleaned up. I
am collecting statistics as to the actual san-
itary work now done in the State and woul like to know whether you have means fo thorough and constant removal of night soi and garbage. If so, how many men and cart are employed in this work ; and what are you laws and regulations on the subject? An earl answer will be much appreciated The following replies have been received—
Morristown, Hon. J. B. Halloway, Mayor:
The sanitary condition of our town is not wha it should be. We have no regular means o removing garbage, etc Tazewell—T. W. Stone, Attorney at law:
Can say that our little town of 400 populatio is not incorporated, therefore we have no
.Mayor. We have no laws and regulations i regard to cleaning the town except the statut laws of our State Kingston—George W. Henderson, Mayor:
Our town, has a sanitary committee, compose of three Aldermen, whose business it is to loo after the removal of night soil and garbage They have done their work well and the tow is in good sanitary condition. The town i situated upon high rolling ground, and i easily drained. Our town is not large enoug to require the constant use of men and carts Only as necessity requires are they used. Ou regulations empower the Sanitary Committe to employ as many men and carts as are re-
quired to keep the town in thorough sanitar condition McMinnville—Hon. Jesse Walling, Mayor:
Will say we are now placing our city in a first-
class sanitary condition, using lime freely an cleaning up well Shelbyville—Hon. John W. Ruth, Mayor:
We have one mule and cart with a driver i constant service and under the direction o our Sanitary Committee. We have verystrin-
gent ordinances requiring all privies, cellar and backyards to be kept clean, which ar regularly inspected by police officers detaile for that duty. All places and backyards ac-
cessible to the public are regularly cleaned u twice a week by the scavenger force of the city Our people have lime furnished them free fo disinfecting purposes. With the recollectio of former visits of cholera to our place, we ar aware of the great need of being in good san-
itary condition. Our scavenger force consist of one mule and cart, two men, including on policeman when on that duty Murfreesboro—Hon. H. E. Palmer, Mayor:
Replying to your letter requesting me to fur-
nish the State Board of Health with th means we (this city) have for " thorough au con tan t removal of garbage and night soil,"' I
beg to say that our town is reasonably wel cleared of garbage twice per week. The la of our corporation requires that private prem-
ises be kept in a clean and healthy condition,
and if it is found that any citizen is negligen in this respect, his premises are ordere cleansed and the occupant subjected to fine Our citizens have been furnished with lim from the public treasury, and our laws exact-
ing its application to sanitary purposes ar sufficiently stringent. The creek which run through the city has been rip-rapped and wel cleaned. We keep constantly employed on eart and three men, for the general purpose of the city Nashville—T. A. Kercheval, Mayor: I reply to your esteemed favor, I would infor you that in the line of removing night soi there are two parties running constantly eac an odorless excavating machine, which i doing good and constant work. In addition t these, there area number of wagons running
•which use the regulation barrels, and they ar doing constant work. I may say, therefore,
that this branch of the sanitary work is bein pretty well served, though I think if the forc was larger there could be plenty of work foun for all of them to do. There is more of thi kiud of work done this year than ever befor in one year, owing to increase in jwpulatio and new residences that have gone up; and i the city continues to grow, of course this wor will increase in proportion. There is a poo portion yet of the privies that have not beo cleaned out. The sanitary officers are takin each his district in systematic order, givi notice to the householder, and the night s<J
scavengers are following on behind doing tj work. The law on this subject is to arre and fine a citizen if he does not have his pri cleaned out within five days after notice giv by the sanitary officer. The garbage force,  aside to haul off garbage, ashes, etc., and J
clean gutters and alleys, is used exclusively I
that purpose and consists of one large ti horse slop wagon, one slop cart, one a.sh wa twelve garbage carts with thirty-three hh
In case of a push, the regular street forc diverted to scavenger duty; the work-ho prisoners, who will average fifteen men I
month, are also worked in the sanitary dep ment. This force is doing fair work, and  much complaint is coming in, though, bu the many and thorough washing rains we h had, doubtless this force could not have swered our purposes. So I should think w the Lord puts in licks for us occasionally!
his copious showers, we maybe able to I
the city in reasonable sanitary condil
Hoping that this will cover the scope of  inquiries, and will reach you in time to A
your purposes, I again thank you for the h you have done me in calling for a report.

Franklin—W. D. Neely, Mayor: We hav a regularly organized Hoard of Health. Dr.
S. J. House is Chairman and Health Officer We instructed him in early spring to mak inspection of the town. This was completed
May 1, and he reported the town at that tim in a very good sanitary condition. Since tha time he has endeavored to keep it in good con-
dition (and has devoted his special attentio to the foulest localities), hut reports it almos impossible to do so. The worst nuisances w have are privy-vaults and pig pens, and wit these exceptions the town is in good condition We have only surface drainage here. Kee constantly employed one man, one mule an cart. The man generally keeps the streets an alleys clean. We have no men employed fo special removal of night soil and garbage When we find a nuisance our law authorize proper officers to proceed at once against own-
ers of the property, and if not abated at  certain time, to enforce the penalty and powe of the law. By this means we usually succeed Columbia—Hon. Jos. Towler, Mayor: I
would state that we have a good code of sani-
tary laws, and they are very well enforced b our Health Officer. Dr. Robt. Pillow We have two carts, with sufficient numbe of hands] as may be necessary, for the remova of garbage. These laws we find very difficul to enforce satisfactorily, but our Health Office in not afraid to do his duty. ■
Huntingdon — Hon. Ceorge T. McCall,
Mayor: In answer to yours I have to say:
We have no organized sanitary system excep a town Board of Health, whose suggestions w try to observe Bolivar —Hon. C. M. Wellons, Mayor:
Would say we have no regular force for th work mentioned. But the City "Marshal i is ordered to notify all persons and to see tha all infective places are thoroughly cleansed This he has attended to and our city is now i good condition. Thanking you for your ad-
vice, and we will try to keep it up Union City—Hon. S. Waddell, Mayor:
Will say that while we have no regularl organized sanitary force we have a committe who looks closely to the sanitary interest o our town and up to date reports sanitary con-
dition good. Of course this committee ha command of all the assistance needed, and w have an officer to inspect vaults, etc., weekly In fact, we are doing all we can to preserv the health of our city and guard against disease Memphis—Hon. D. P. Hadden, President
Taxing District: We now have our eye turned toward all sanitary matters and thin our city is now in a condition to ward off al diseases The above correspondence gives a correc view of the present state of local sanitation in
Tennessee. Only three or four municipalitie in the entire State are awake to the importanc of this, the crowning feature of modern civili-
zation, to-wit. healthy homes for all the people Reviewing the work of this Board for thre years, beginning with July 1, 1884, one is dis-
appointed that so little apparent progress ha been made. During these three years a ver large proportion of the meagre funds of this
Board has been expended in printing and cir-
culating sanitary documents and tracts sys-
tematically throughout Tennessee. No count has been overlooked. Special care has bee taken to' get at all county, city and Stat officials. Physicians, clergymen, lawyers, lead-
ing manufacturers and farmers have all bee reached. In this work the press of Tennesse has also assisted with characteristic liberality While very much has been done in effectin a thorough organization of County Boards of
Health, and in creating popular interest i sanitary progress, it is evident that the tim has come for carrying out the plan propose by Dr. Thornton, at the quarterly meeting o this Board, July 7,1885, namely, directing the
Secretary to lecture on " Local Sanitation" i the principal towns of the State, and also t instruct local Health Officers as to the bes methods of dealing with cases of contagiou diseases, and reporting same to this Board On the 7th and 8th of September I attende closely all the sessions of the National Confer-
ence of State boards of health at Washington The main business transacted was a sligh modification of the compact adopted at To-
ronto, respecting inter-State notification of
'nfectious diseases, so as to render it mor easy of observance The Monthly Bulletin may now be re-
garded as permanently a feature of the Board' work. It should be enlarged by four addi-
tional pages, so as to give space for fulle information respecting sanitary matters in
Tennessee, thus much increasing its interes at home and abroad As a means of making Tennessee favorabl known abroad, this periodical is certainl doing all concerned much credit, and it ough to be distributed far more extensively tha our means now allow The constantly increasing clerical work i this office makes it necessary and economica to purchase a type-writer and cyclo-style fo the use of the single clerk furnished as m assistant.

haps, the abnormally high temperature abou the 10th—14th. There were but few electrica disturbances, and no very high winds The mean temperature was 70°.5, about the

Matter Our Peril What the political views of the officers o the New York Quarantine Station are now o may be, is of but little interest to any beyon themselves; but what their method and prac-
tice is in preventing the introduction into thi country of the germs of exotic pestilentia disease, has a deep personal interest for eac of the seventy-five millions of human being who inhabit this continent. The simple an-
nouncement that vessels with Asiatic choler on board had recently arrived at New York,
sent a thrill over the whole country, and whe later the Associated Press dispatches expose the lax methods observed by these quarantin officials, in dealing with those infected vessel and crews, a wide-spread feeling, bordering o panic, was aroused. The facts given show tha while these officials are struggling for place,
their responsibilities and duties, as such, see to be either ignored or forgotten, as passenger with unopened packages of bedding, baggage,
et cetera, el cetera, direct from districts alon the Mediterranean, where cholera is raging a a malignant epidemic, are permitted to pas this quarantine station unmolested to point in the interior, there probably to scatter th seeds of the dread disease. The vigilan health officers of Chicago, Cleveland, Balti-
more, and Philadelphia, all report having lo-
cated and isolated for observation a numbe of these passengers, and also to have thor-
oughly disinfected their effects, or entirel destroyed the same by burning. For this,
outside of their several communities, the pu lie owe them a debt of gratitude. Again, th statement is given of one whose character i vouched for, that a few nights since he rowe to Hoffman'8 Island, where the cholera sus-
pects are supposed to be, and should be, undo-
ne closest surveillance, that nobody interfere with him, that he trafficked with them, an on leaving, carried eight letters ashore to mail While there, he was told that a number of thj'
detained passengers from off these infecte vessels had escaped from quarantine, and that-
from all he could see, there was nothing t prevent his boat load from doing likewise, a he returned to shore, if they chose. Whil possibly some of the details as given abov may be overdrawn, yet the fact stands out t be seen of all men that the quarantine of New
York, under its present management, afford no protection whatever to the American pub-
lic against the importation of this Asiati pest, and with the additional fact before u that eighty per cent, of the 334,203 immigrant who arrived in this country in 1886, cam through the port of New York, the extent o our peril would seem indeed to be alarming Health officers in Tennessee, and every-
where else throughout the country, for that,
matter, would do well to recognize the solem farce being enacted at the quarantine statio of New York—the inexcusable condition o affairs reported at this our most dangerou and least protected point, aud if Governor
Hill can not be induced to promptly remov this blot from off his otherwise strong adminis-
tration, which seems to fall but little short o a reckless tampering with the public health,
they should set about at once to make ever possible preparation to meet what, at thi writing, seems inevitable.

BY DANIEL P. WRIGHT, 11. D.
ANIMAL FOOD,
[Since these papers have been commence there has appeared in the Century Magazin a series of article* under the heading "The
Chemistry of Food and Nutrition." Recog-
nizing the great scientific merit of these essays,
we had at one time thought of abandoning th subject to another bettor qualified to treat it,
but on reconsideration we find that the pur-
pose of that writer is not precisely the same a ours, and have concluded that there is roo for both of us. We shall therefore confin ourselves to a practically hygienic treatmen of the subject; at the same time we cordiall commend 10 our readers the study of Prof Atwater's description of the scientific method by which a minute quantitative analysis of th process of nutrition has been made possible.]
Tlie substances we described in our las paper, the carbo-hydrates and oils, take n part in the solid structure of the body except,
perhaps, in the elaboration of fat, but ar mainly consumed in the process of respiration,
whereby heat and other vital forces are kept up We now come to the consideration of a entirely different class of materials, those typi-
cally represented by the flesh, or (to be mor precise), by the muscular tissue of animals Substances of this class have already re-
ceived some of our attention under the name of albumen and casein in eggs, ratuin in milk,
and gluten in wheat and other grains used fo bread. The muscles of animals consist mainl of another substance of the class entitled myo-
,<(«(!. All these may be considered as chem-
ically identical, except for the presence i varying proportions of minute quantities o sulphur and phosphorus, and have been treate by physiologists as modifications of a hypot het-
ical compound which they have named protei or protoplasm It consists of four elements in the followin proportion: A hundred parts of protein, con-
tain
(Part: in 100.)
Carbon 53.8
Hydrogen 7.
X i I rogen 15.7
Oxygen 23.5
In albumen, the most common of protein com-
pounds, part of the oxygen is replaced by sul-
phur, in the following proportion:
Oxvgen 22.3
Sulphur 1.2
The radical difference between these sub-
stances and those described in our forme papers is that, whereas the carbo-hydrates, fats,
etc., consist exclusively of carbon, hydroge and oxygen, these are distinguished by th presence of a fourth element, nitrogen. Thei destination in the body marks a still more im-
portant distinction, thus:
All the others have to be decomposed an resolved into their original constituents o carbonic anhydride and water, before they ca subserve their purpose in tin; evolution o heat; but these protein compounds are appro-
priated as new substance incorporated in th animal tissues without chemical change. I other words, the muscular flesh of animals i. consumed as food and becomes a portion o human muscular tissue, chemically unchanged It was niyosiue when eaten, and continues t be niyosiue when it becomes human muscle So that, whether a hog eats man's flesh or ma eats hog's flesh, the process is the same, huma muscle becomes porcine muscle, or porcin human, according to which eats and which i eaten. Hence, emphatically the protein co pounds are designated nutritive or flesh-pro-
ducing foods, and the carbo-hydrates,oils, etc..
respiratory or heat-producing foods; a dis-
tinction, however, w hich must not be draw too closely, since the protein compounds ulti-
mately produce heat by their decompositio when done with, and the carbo-hydrates ar unquestionably metamorphosed in the anima system so as to produce fat There is another class of compounds, als containing nitrogen, but not capable of bein appropriated to the repair and growth of ani-
mal tissues. These are the materials of car-
tilage, fibrous tissues, membranes, and of ex-
tractive matters derived by pressure, boiling,
etc., from flesh. They have of late bee treated by physiologists as of no dietetic value,
perhaps without sufficient consideration,  question which will presently be considered They enter into our food catalogue in th form of soups, jellies and gravies Having thus briefly considered the chemica constitution of food materials, we have now t investigate those methods of administratio which determine their nutritive and sanitar value An eminent English agriculturalist, the late
Karl of Leicester, used to say that, in order t have good beef it must be well bred, well fed.
killed aright, kept aright, cooked aright an eaten aright, any of which provisions bein neglected the beef is ruined. These aphor-
isms of the good old earl may be taken xs the
Srogram of a treat ise on healthy food. Claud lemard has well said that the differen species of animals require different food, no so much as regards its chemical ingredients,
as in respect to the form in which they ar presented. For instance, a chicken will liv and grow fat on a few handfuls of barley, i the presence of which a dog would starve t death; but this is not because the barley i destitute of the material essential to the dog' nutrition, but because the dog's digestiv organs are incapable of reducing it to a con-
dition adapted to its assinilation. Grind th barley into meal and make a cake of it, an the dog can eat it and grow fat on it. Th difference is, that the chicken has a mill in its

39
gizzard with which it can grind the grain,
while the dog has to rely on man for th grinding Thus all this matter of the preparation o food, the breeding, feeding, killing, cookin and eating, is simply a mode of adapting it t the peculiar structure of the digestive orga in man; to estimate, therafore, the merits o the processes enumerated, we must examin the human digestive organs and the digestiv process which goes on in them To put the matter in as simple a form a possible, let it be understood that all animals,
from man down to the minute organisms in-
visible to the naked eye, require the sam chemical ingredients in their food, namely,
protoplasm in some form, carbo-hydrates o oil or both, and certain salts of lime, iron, so-
da, etc., formed by the combination of these—
substances with carbonic, phosphoric and sul-
phuric acid. The microscopic organisms w have alluded to, without any special digestiv organs, absorb them directly from the water i which they float; others, a little higher in na-
ture's scale, attach themselves to the surfac of still higher creatures and obtain them para-
sitieally from the juices prepared by the digest-
ive organs of their patrons. So far no specia digestive system is required, as the nutritiv materials are presented in the form require by those simple organizations, without prepar-
ation. But above these are animals of a su-
perior organization which live by devourin bodily the substance of vegetables and animal previously organized. As soon as we arrive a this stage of existence we also arrive at th necessity for a special digestive system, adapte to the special form of the food consumed Thus, the digestive system of the carnivor is very simple and comprised in a small space,
while that of the herbivora is complex an voluminous for reasons which can be easil stated. The animal food of the carnivora pre-
sents the protoplasmic elements in very nearl the same proportions and mode of combinatio as they exist in the bodies to be nourished On the other hand, the vegetable food of th herbivora contains indeed protoplasmic ele-
ments, but these are mixed with starch an cellulose, which are carbo-hydrates, in suc overwhelming preponderance that it takes a immense quautity of such food to supply enoug protoplasm tor the needs of the system. Thu the digestive organs of these animals have t contain a much larger quantity of food at  time than those of the carnivora, and a muc more elaborate apparatus for separating th nutritious from the innutritions elements o the food, and for reducing to a form capable o assimilation those which are destined to usefu purposes in the animal system. The most un-
lnstructed enquirer who has ever seen the in-
testines of a carnivorous and a herbivorou animal, a dog and a sheep, for instance, canno fail to notice the simplicity of the former a compared with the magnitude and complicit of the latter Now, man is neither exclusively carnivo-
rous nor herbivorous but omnivorous. Hi digestive apparatus is something intermediat between the two, but approaches nearer to th carnivorous type. 80 long as he remains  savage and lives by the chase, he does wel enough as a carnivorous animal; but as soo as he cultivates the land ho assumes the mixe type, and combines the vegetable and the ani-
mal diet. This combination implies the art o cookery, for almost all vegetable food require preparation before human digestive organs ca assimilate it, and in the duly prepared mixe food he finds a means of subsistence both mor economical and better adapted to the develop-
ment of those faculties in regard to which h stands apart from and above all other livin creatures Our next paper, therefore, will be concerne with man as an animal capable of appropriatin to his own nutrition all those classes of food,
one or other of which are, respectively, th support of one or other of the aiverse being which stand beneath him in the scale of crea-
tion, a capacity which depends upon the em-
ployment of his reason in the selection, combi-
nation and preparation of the various food ele-
ments.

dysentery of a grave form, some of iliem termina-
ting fatally The most singular phenomenon o the month was the frequency of .the occurrence o jaundice.
(JibiiOH county—Dr. T.J Happvl, County Health
Officer.—The month of October showed an im-
provement in the health of this portion of th county. Remittent fever decreased, catarrhal dis-
eases increased. Typhoid fever still occurs spo-
radically in many portions of the county In Tren-
ton there have been two cases. In the jail I hav treated three cases of measles. It was not permit-
ted to spread outside the jail Milan—M. I). L. Jordan, M. P.—With the ex-
ception of bad colds and an occasional case o catarrhal pneumonia, the country lias had excel-

monia have also been present. Altogether I thin there is le.-s sickness this month than last Cltattaneona—Dr. J R. Rathmell, President; Dr.
E. A. Cobleigh, Secretary City Board of Health.—
For the month of October I have to report a gen-
eral improvement in the gross amount of sicknes prevalent in Chattanooga. Dysentery has oc-
curred with considerable frequency. Whooping-
cough lingers among us in a mild form, and not s wide spread. Diphtheria was reported during
October as becoming rather prevalent, and I made
Fpecial inquiries regarding it among physicians,
but could learn of only one or two cases havin semblance to this dread scourge; and no case were reported to my office, though the law require such report from practicing physicians in the cas of all contagious diseases falling under their care.
I therefore regard the reports of its prevalence a unfounded. Coughs, colds and catarrhal disease increase as winter draws near; pneumonia become more frequent, and there have been fatal case during the mouth. Fevers are not so widesprea as during midsummer, though the ratio of fata cases has been greater since close rooms becam necessary for comfort, and the season advanced The death from typhoid of several prominen people in rapid succession, and the serious illnes of others, attracted public attention to this feve among us, and created a false impression that i was on the increase, when in reality the contrar was the case Much divergence of opinion ha been manifest among physicians as to the exist-
ence of typhoid fever here, notwithstanding it prevalence in neighboring cilies, and more gen-
erally than usual in most all the towns of lower
East Tennessee. As to your correspondent he ha no hesitancy in his opinion as to the typhoi character of some of the fevers falling under hi observation. It is the general belief too, that th year has been one of greater fever prevalence tha common all over the country, and that this cit has been no exception to that rule. The predomi-
nating type of disease, however, has been malarial,
and these attacks are frequent now, though gradu-
ally lessening. Except as aforementioned, w have no epidemic* and comparatively little sickness Hancock county—Dr. Win. P. Mahan, County
Health Officer.—No report received Hmilemun county—Dr Jas. J. Neely, Jr., County
Health Officer.—The health of (his county for th month of October was never better There are n epidemics or contagious diseases prevailing with-
in its borders, and very little sickness from acci-
dental causes. The principal prevailing affection are catarrhal, from colds which require but littl remedial interference to rectify them. The town in the county are all in pretty good sanitary con-
dition and, in anticipation of the approach o cholera, more work will be done. I have hear of one case of diphtheria—ending in recovery Hardin county—Dr. J. K. Barlow, County
Health Officer.—No report received Hawkins county—Dr. R. P. Mitchell, County
Health Officer.—There is still some typhoid feve raging in this county—one fatal case since my las report. One death from paralysis, one fro phthisis pulmonalis, and one from old age. Thi county has been remarkably healthy during th last month Haywood county—Dr. J. H. Howell, County"

Officer.—No report received Johnson county—Dr. J. W. Donnelly, County
Health Officer.—No report received Knox county.—Dr. W. M. Rutherford, County

:r.:e~po:r.t fob October,, issv October was characterized by the large per-
centage of" clear or fair weather and the almos total absence of electrical disturbances. Th other features showed but slight departure from the normal. The cold wave which passe over the State on the 5th, resulted in a ligh frost in the Eastern and Middle divisions Altogether, the month was a delightful one The mean temperature was 55°.9, slightl below the normal October mean of the pas five years. The maximum temperature ob-
served, was 90°, recorded on the 10th, and wa the highest October maximum during the fiv years, except in 1884, when it reached 99D The minimum temperature was 22°, recorde on the 31st, and was, together with the Octobe minimum in 1884, the lowest in the above cor-
responding period. The monthly range o temperature was the greatest October rang during the above period, except in 1881 There were three cold-wave predictions durin the month, viz: 4th-5th, 24th-25th, and 29th-
30th, all of which were fully verified The mean precipitation for the month was
2.57 inches, slightly below the normal of th past five years. Of this amount the Easter division received an average of three and  quarter inches, the Middle division, two and  half inches, and the Western division, tw inches. The greatest rainfall was 5.60 inches,
reported at Fostoria, and the least was 1.22
inch, reported at Milan. The greatest rainfal in 24 consecutive hours, was 3.30 inches, re-
ported at Fostoria. on the 19th. The first hal of the month was almost rainless, slight show-
ers being reported on the 1st, 10th and 11th From the 17th to the 25th, inclusive, nearly al the rain of the month was received, the rain of the 17th, 24th and 25th being general, th others mostly local, and generally light. Th heaviest rain of the month fell on the 24th About fifteen days were without measurabl rainfall. Frosts were reported on about te days, several of these, notably, on the 12th,
13th, 22d and 31st were killing frosts, th others mostly light. Dews were reported o about eight days. On the 30th there was  very slight fall of snow in the Eastern and
Middle divisions; the greatest amount fell at
Greeneville, but at most of the other station it was scarcely noticeable The percentage of verifications of weathe and temperature predictions furnished dail from the Signal Office at Washington to th various stations in the State during th month, was for the State: weather, 80.3 pe cent,, and temperature 80.2 per cent Thunderstorms were reported as follows:

below low water of September 5th, 1863, 19t to 23d; monthly range, 2.1 foot The TT. S. Observer at Nashville reports th rainfall for October, 0.93 inch below the six-
teen-year average at his station, The averag annual rainfall is 50.88 inches; on November
1, there was a deficiency of 2.64 inches The new voluntary station at Vernon, in
Hickman county, has been changed to Nun-
nelly, a station on the railroad, a mile or tw east of Vernon. The new observer, Mr. H.
('. Thompson, promises to sustain the goo reputation of the station, lately in the hand of Mr. David L. Spence, who is now taking  course of studv in meteorology and astronom at VanderbiltUniversity. The station at Rid-
dleton, for nearly five years in the excellen hands of Mr. Sterling P, Fergusson, is now i charge of his younger brother, Mr. Frank K Fergusson, who also gives promise of uphold-
ing the interests of the Service during th absence of his brother. While it is to be regret-
ted that the Service in the State, temporaril loses Mr. Fergusson the elder, who has bee called to fill quite a responsible position at
Blue Hill Observatory, near Boston, Mass., i is gratifying to know that he is in a position t exercise the full extent of his zeal and enthu-
siam in the study of his favorite science, an that he will reflect due credit on himself an his State, there is little room to doubt. I his work, he very fortunately has, for hi immediate associate and preceptor, Mr. H Helm Clayton, another young Tennessean, wh has active charge of the work at the Observa-
tory, and whose earnest and energetic work i the interests of meteorology has been promptl recognised, and whose papers on the scienc have been widely copied in scientific journals,
and who is already in the front rank amon the young meteorologists of the country. I is peculiarly gratifying to note that these young
Tennesseans—formerly voluntary observers i the State Weather Service—have met wit such rapid recognition of their merits, an that the fame of their illustrious fellow Ten-
nessean, the great Prof. Maury, may be thei incentive to higher honors in the great scienc of meteorology. It is safe to say, the bes wishes of their co-laborers in the Service iu
Tennessee, attend them Summary of the Meteorological Repor of the State Board of Healt for October, 1887 Mean barometer, 30.09 inches Maximum observed, 30.38 iuches, at Milan,

iic PER ANNir.M Entered at the Postnffii-e nt Nashville as Second Class
Matter Look Out for Small-Pox The recent outbreak of small pox at Mor-
ganville, a town on the Louisville it Nashville
Railroad, a little south of Montgomery, Ala.,
produced quite an excitement in the neigh-
boring region Inasmuch as the intercourse between Ala-
bama and the three divisions of Tennessee i exceedingly frequent and very intimate, all ou physicians and health officials should be on th alert Let it not be forgotten that so far as vaccin-
ation is concerned, perhaps three-fourths o nur people are unprotected. Our safety lie in extreme watchfulness, prompt, isolation an care of the first eases, and in perfect sanita-
tion If the history of Montreal, disastrous in al points of view, is repeated in any Tennesse town, city or district, the blame must and wil rest upon the local authorities, municipal an county American Public Health Association Memphis Meeting In the Daily Commercial, Chattanooga,
November 18, 1887, occurs the following ex-
cellent review of one of the most important
Sanitary Congresses ever held in Tennessee:
At a meeting of the Board of Health las night, Secretary E. A. Cobleigh, M. D., rea the following interesting paper Mr. President and Gentlemen:
As your delegate to the American Public
Health Association, I went to Memphis o the 7th inst., and attended its sessions The Association was presided over bv tha distinguished scientific investigator, Major
George M. Sternberg, U. S. A.,and our meeting were held in the United States court room a the custom house. I joined the associatio your secretary, and by becoming a membe will obtain a bound copy of its proceedings s soon as issued from the press. This book is  large and valuable one and will contain muc information which it may be convenient fo us to draw upon hereafter in public healt matters.
I also, so far as I had opportunity, familiar-
ized myself with the working of the sanitar machinery of such cities as were represente in the Association, paying particular attentio in the limited time at my command to the ques-
tions of garbage and its disposal, slops, night soil,
the inspection of food animals and adulterate foods, sewer gas, quarantine, infectious dis-
eases and things of this character affecting th health of all cities and towns. Chattanooga a we all know is a growing and rapidly growin place, and in the very near future—aye, indee now—theseare tobequestions of vast and vita importance to us. In sanitation we lag behin and to-day are only in a crudely formative stag as to public hygiene. All this must be remedie and remedied very soon—and feeling the nee of studying these questions, for practical goo to my city, they had great interest to me. 1
not only gathered all the information possibl from the public meetings of the Association,
but I personally inspected the sewer system of

  p. 50 (#56)                        5(1
STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLET IN Memphis, the details of her engineer's office,
and by elaborate private inquiries drew  vast fund of facts from the numerous gentle-
men in attendance who are officially and act-
ively engaged in the sanitation of many differ-
ent cities of varying size.
I submit herewith a map and printed circu-
lar giving detailed information about th whole system. For the low lying and leve portions of Chattanooga, as almost the entire
Fifth ward, the south-eastern part of the
Fourth ward and the western section of the
Third ward, the Waring system as used at
Memphis is practical, if it be demonstrated a the best and most economical. Ventilatio for sewer gas at Memphis is provided by la for each house above the roof, and they hav no trouble from this source. One point i this connection of practical interests—some o the cities represented at our meeting save t property owners large sums of money by run-
ning their sewers mainly through the alley instead of the streets. By this meaus the dis-
turbance of pavements by repairs, and of side-
walks by house connections is largely avoided,
and the proximity of the sewer to the wate closets and kitchen sinks, which are almos invariably in the rear part of the houses o yards, insures short house pipes aud less cos than long soil stems from the same house through the front yards and to the center of  wide street. With regard to sewer gas, on of the gentlemen of the health department of
Brooklyn, N. Y., told me that by a series o practical tests and experiments the healt office of that city had demonstrated that  pressure of only three and one-half pounds i the pipes is sufficient to force this gas back-
ward through a twenty-foot column of water He also informed me that in Brooklyn typhoi fever is most prevalent and fatal in the wealth-
iest sections of the city where the most costl houses and elaborate system of scientifi plumbing obtain. This lie attributes to th tight buildings, the greater modem conve-
niences they possess thus numerically increas-
ing the sewer pipes in the premises, and th fact that the occupants go off for months eac year to summer resorts and almost hermetic-
ally seal the houses in their absence, and tlie return to breathe the pent up accumulation of contaminated air without the rooms eve receiving thorough ventilation The next subject of interest to me was th question of garbage and its disposal—especial-
ly in the light of our health officer's state-
ment that something must be done by ou city after January 1st looking to a riddance o garbage, owing to the expiration of our pres-
ent lease of ground used tor dumping pur-
poses. The best plan I could learn of for dis-
posing of vegetable and animal garbage,
capable of food consumption for swine, is th system in use in several Massachusetts citie and Minneapolis, where larue stock-yards ar run outside the city limits for the feeding o hogs, either by the municipality, the count poor farms, or private individuals who pay th cities royalty for the privilege, and in eac case the plan proves profitable for all con-
cerned. The next most common and practi-
cal method of disposal is by dumping int lakes and rivers off of boats constructed fo the purpose, and by carts also adapted to suc working in the most expeditious way. Bu this plan everywhere arouses violent opposj-
tion, often litigation, and is open to the seri-
ous objection of more or less obstructing Sow-
ing streams and pollution of the water suppl below the dumping ground The last plan, and the one rising into great-
est favor because it disposes of every characte of garbage except old tin and other incombus-
tibles, is by burning in peculiarly constructe furnaces. This is a method open to few ob-
jections, is just now perfected, is economica and disposes also of ashes, rags, leather an even night soil in large quantities, and afte starting the furnace up it affords its own fue from the rubbish supplied to it. I am to hav illustrations and descript ive circulars of thes furnaces by mail in a day or two, and will fil the same with this report for future referenc by the board The removal and ultimate disposition o night soil in a city like Chattanooga with it hundreds of vaults, is a question of vital im-
port even now, and growing greater year b year. It is something that ought to be reache effectively by the board of health an city council very soon and be regulated b stringent laws. On this subject T can say ver little, despite its importance. Of course, a our sewer system grows this evil decreases, ex-
cept as it extends constantly beyond the sewe limits by accretion of inhabtants. The mos economical plan of riddance for night soil i that obtaining where farmers are glad to get i for composting and fertilizing purposes, es-
pecially market gardeners, and in such town the health authorities absolutely make th privilege of removing night soil a source o revenue by selling licenses to a few persons a good prices. Tn Springfield, Mass., Dr. Bic gets (in a cityjust the size of Chattanooga) $50
a year each from ten men for this work They employ as many carts as they need unde very rigid regulations, and make their profi both off the property owner who has to pa them a ice for cleaning up his premises an the surrounding farmers who buy their nigh soil. The municipal health board, however,
supervises the entire system and directs thes men what premises need cleaning and when t do it. The only other plans for this work ar by dumping in water courses, burying i trenches away from the center of population,
or burning as before mentioned, and the las is the best of the three Among other things of moment that cam before the Association for consideration, bu which I will merely mention in pass ins, were
"death certificates and burial permits, thei necessity in large cities and their forms," and

the inspection of food cattle and foods to pre-
vent diseases and detect adulterations. Bot of these, and particularly the last, are worth of our consideration. The first we alread have in good practical shape. The latter i important to Chattanooga and ought to receiv the legislative attention of the boards of healt and aldermen, especially when the new mar-
ket-house opens. It is a matter of every da observation that stale fruits, decayed vege-
tables, diseased poultry aud ancient eggs ar exposed for sale on our streets—yes, and ar actually bought and consumed (as 1 have bee assured by dealers) by a class of the populatio who will buy anything that seems cheap an who furnish the bulk of our mortality tables All this should be obviated in the interest o public health The subject of quarantine just now is a mo-
mentous one. Only recently this whole natio stood in suspense, jealously and anxiousl watching the result of quarantine at the por of New York. Happily the outcome ther was a victory for the officials and a triump for science. I wish I had time to give yo a minute account of the interesting details,
both of that station and the one below New
Orleans, including the short sighted parsi-
mony of those who furnished funds for equip-
ping and operating the New York establish-
ment (because no actual epidemic was at thei doors) and the vast difficulties its officials sur-
mounted in successfully stamping out th pestilence which threatened invasion. Not th least of these difficulties was the active an concerted opposition of the immigrants them-
selves to all measures looking to their welfare,
with grim hatred manifested toward all doc-
tors as in their native land, during the whol epidemic, lasting now for two years, and thei secretiveness by which cholera victims droppe dying off their feet before the medical officer could ever learn that they were complaining But I have not time to elaborate on these matter in this paper. I can merely say that it wa the general sense of the Memphis conventio that we, as a nation, are to face the dangers o a cholera epidemic next year. Nothing bu the stern intervention of the general govern-
ment by refusing to allow infected vessels t touch our coasts is regarded as affording ade-
quate protection from the invasion of the Asi-
atic scourge. And it is considered doubtfu whether the government has the right unde existing treaties and under the laws of mari-
time commerce to take such a radical cours of dealing with the danger. Wherefore quaran-
tine stations are being reinforced, and th guns of the batteries of science are bein trained and double-shotted to cope, we hope,
triumphantly with the unwelcome foe. Ever possible precaution will be taken and every-
thing done that science can suggest and skil apply, to absolutely ward off from United
States soil the least trace of infection. Al this is good and right, but it has been don before and the history of the past tells us tha it was ultimately futile then aud probably wil be so again. And if history repeats itself th grim destroyer will enter by some route—per-
haps at an obscure and unguarded point—an then, without prompt and heroic measures o suppression, his march is sure. Now it ha been suggested to me that capital is timid an the agitation of this question "hurts trade"
by preventing investments. That was an argu-
ment used during the war at almost every wa measure that was broached. It is the argu-
ment that permits puerile inaction to sap one' strength in the face of danger and leaves one' forces powerless when the time comes for act ion It is tne argument of the individual dolla against the public weal, against the welfare o the great masses and the commonwealth Better stare stern reality in the face aud " i time of peace prepare for war."
The danger is not to Chattanooga or New
Orleans or any one locality in particular, tha capital should tremble and avoid that place,
but to the whole nation, and it behooves us t be up and doing now so that when cholera
—if come it shall—our city and our sectio shall be prepared to ward it off altogether i possible by a perfect system of sanitation,
cleanliness and quarantine. Thus we do no frighten capital or injure business, but we con-
serve the welfare of both capital and business,
and prevent a publicpanic, stampede and com-
mercial calamity. Forewarned is forearmed Let us reason as men and not like boys, prov-
ing pennywise and pound foolish. It is to late for effective sanitary work when the pesti-
lence is upon us. The work must be don during the coming winter aud spring, and the we are ready for cholera and may absolutel keep it away from our city by furnishing it n soil for propagation. The danger of invasio now is greater than ever before in the histor of this continent, for during 1887 cholera ha threatened us from Europe, South Americ and the Orient by the way of China in thre different directions, and has slowly drawn it toils nearer and nearer to our shores. The as the danger is increased so should the warn-
ing be heeded and the efforts at preventio magnified. Let a stitch be taken in time an thus save the proverbial nine. This is the feel-
ing of health authorities all over the land, an every where increased activity in sanitary meas-
ures of cities is being inaugurated, and this is th very best sign of the times one could ask, bod-
ing well for the future And now if there is aught in this report o which you wish to hear from me more in de-

Throughout the month the weather has bee delightful beyond description. The atmos-

France The observer at Savannah remarks: Fores fires raged in our county from the 14th to the
23d. doing considerable damage to fences an timber, and destroying a large amount of
"mast"—white oak and post oak—upon whic hogs could have subsisted nearly all winter The observer at Milan remarks: On the
22d the whole country is enveloped in smoke,
and has been since the 4th. The drouth i very severe—ponds and creeks dried up, well have failed in some sections-, necessitatin hauling water some distance for family use an for stock. Forest fires raging over extensiv tracts of country, doing much damage t farms and fencing The observer at Trenton remarks: Almos continually from the 1st to the 19th everythin obscured by smoke so dense as to penetrat into dwellings and be painful to the eyes Foiest tires in the north and west portion of the county, reaching the vicinity of Tren-
ton, destroying dead timber and fencing t several farms. Several out-buildings and gin reported burned, also standing corn in fields The mast, which was abundant and sufficien to carry stock hogs through tlie winter withou corn, is reported swept away. Everything i dry and parched Tip and highly inflammable,
and almost general consternation prevails.

SCBSPRII'TION.
25c PEK ANNUM Entered at the Pofltoffiofl at Nashville ns second Class Matter Climatology Elsewhere in this i-suc will be found the Hoard' meteorological report for 1887, in addition to th monthly report for December. The data thu presented is of much value, as it is from a contin-
uous record of this kind alone that it becomes pos-
sible to study with profit those vital, varied an complex questions which are involved in any in-
telligent consideration of the subject—climate Upon July 18, 1885, the State Board of Health,
upon the solicitation of Hon. A. J. MeWhirter,
Commissioner of Agriculture, assumed control o the then called "State Weather Service," th chief inducement to do so was to enlarge its scop of scientific application; that is, while continuin and so far as possible increasing its benefits to th agricultural and live stock interests in the State,
to utilize the data collected in defining the advan-
tages and benefits of our salubrious and equabl climate upon human health and longevity. Cli-
matic changes and atmospheric conditions hav from the earliest periods been recognised as im-
portant factors in modifying or causing many o the diseases affecting the bodies of men or animals It has been customary to connect the great epi-
demics with atmospheric peculiarities. Whil atmospheric changes may not be the immediat cause of diseases of the contagious type, they ma very considerably influence the effects of the tru causes of those diseases, and this specially in re-
gard to the mortality induced by the diseases. Th class of diseases springing directly from atmos-
pheric causes and the class springing from conta-
gion is often very refined and it would appear pos-
sible, if not probable, that some diseases which ar induced by atmospheric variations may pass int the diseases which are communicable by contagion Common cold or catarrh is one of these diseases o the border line. That common cold is sometime communicable from one |K?rson to another is a hypothesis based on repeated observation, and tha from common cold other diseases, more distinctl contagious, such as influenza, may arise, is  theory resting on a good basis of fact. This wor the State Board of Health have undertaken, and t that end they have organized a Meteorological De-
partment, to which Private H.C. Bate,Signal Corps,
has been assigned to duty as assistant upon the orde of Chief Signal Officer A. W. Greely, U. S. A.
HEALTH IN TENNESSEE Extract of Reports of Health Officers and Official Corres-

Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, January 3, 1888 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health i
Sir—When the reports for December are printe an approximate analysis of sickness in Tennesse for the year 1887 may be bad, somewhat frag-
mentary, indeed, yet of much value and interes because of the great variety, geologically and cli-
matically, which characterizes the State It is to be regretted that our correspondents d not take time and pains to make their report more full and definite. Until the much neede registration of births, deaths and marriages is es-
tablished, these reports are the sole means o forming an opinion as to health and sickness i the State Early in February, 1886, a communication from
President Plunket as follows was sent to eacl county health officer in the State:
"Dear Sir—It is the desire of the State Boar of Health to publish hereafter in th<> Bulletin  monthly summary of the health in Teunessee. T do so at all satisfactorily, it is necessary thai ever county should be heard from. You are therefor asked to mail a statement as to the healthfulness o your county so far as you may have personal know-
ledge or hearsay will enable you to state, for th month just past. Give the prevailing disease and give them in the order of their greater prev-
alence. This data, it is true, will De far fro accurate, but, as a general indicator, it will pos-
sess a relative value, and will constitute in realit a practical beginning of what in time we hope t secure—a complete system of vital statistics fo the State.
"Your cordial co-operation is respectfully so-
licited, and upon the first of each month, begin-
ning with the first of March proximo, and so o for every month thereafter, please mail to this of-
fice your report, thus allowing ample time for it reception here and arrangement in proper for for publication. The Bulletin goes to press o the 5th of each month."
This request has been followed up steadily b the issuance and careful circulation of the Bul-
letin for the nearly two years since passed During the last quarter special letters have bee sent to all our correspondents, making Buch sug-
gestions in each case as might seem uece?sary As in 1886 so in 1887, Tennessee has been en-
tirely free from small-pox, not a single case, eve of varioloid, having been reported. This exemp-
tion will probably lead to carelessness in usin preventive measures, which carelessness in tur will be followed by disastrous consequences The year has been marked by signficant pre-
monitions of yellow fever. The events at Key
West and at Tampa in Florida, while illustratin notably the efficacy of modern scientific vigilanc and sanitary precaution in checking the spread o a much dreaded pestilence, speak loudly as  warning of threatened danger. Eight years hav now elapsed since yellow fever scourged one fa-
mous city and frightened the entire Southland It is time to look out As to cholera, the people of the entire Unio and Dominion are on the qui vive. Its prolonge existence in Europe and its ravages in South
America are universally recognized as a doubl menace to the United States and Canada. The

telegraphic columns of the daily press give to ou millions every fact concerning its spread or prev-
alence. The people are more alarmed than Board of Health Wc can not be surprised at this uneasiness; fo where is the populous city or country village i tit sanitary condition to meet thisor any virulen epidemic?
When the well established fact is called to min that the daily and systematic carrying out of san-
itary measures in home, hospital or city dimin-
ishes liability to many diseases and greatly pro-
motes recovery from any and all ailments, th stupidity and lethargy of municipal authorities,
big and little, can never be sufficiently admired.
I submit herewith a communication from th secretary of " The National Pure Food Movement,"
requesting the co-operation of this Board in th convention to be held in Washington, D. C.,-Jan-
uary 19th. Also one from the secretary of the
"National Conference of State Boards of Health,"
in reference to the meeting in June, 1888 By request of Dr. P. D. Sims, I visited Chatta-
nooga, November 28th, and with him conferre with the local Board of Health, the mayor, an members of the city council, as to the sanitar wants of that rapidly growing centre of manu-
factures and commerce. Much interest was man-
ifested by all concerned. Time will show th result The following counties have as yet not complie with the law making it obligatory to establis county Boards of Health: Anderson, Cheatham,
Claiborne, Clay, Dickson, Fentress, Grundy, Hen-
derson, Hickman, Meigs, Monroe, Trousdale,
Union and Warren. The chairman of eac county court has been recently written to and hi attention called to the statute, so that the defec may be remedied at the quarterly session held i the current month There are mauy neat, beautiful and growin towns in Tennessee which should have sanitar laws and registers of vital statistics, as in Cali-
fornia, Ohio and other States. Michigan h:is ove twelve hundred local boards Great progress would be made in public healt if each incorporated town in Tennessee should a once carry out the spirit of the act establishing
• this Board in 1877. That act makes it obligator upon every municipality having five thousand in-
habitants to organize a Board of Health whic shall act in concert with the State Board. Tulla-
homa has recently set a good example in this re-
spect Wide experience has Bhown that small village and towns need public health regulations no les imperatively than great cities The following additions have been made to th library of the Board during the last quarter:

J. Berrien Lindsley, M. D.,
Secretary and Executive Officer Dr. Safford, chairman of the Committee on
Water Supply, made a verbal report on the ar-
tesian wells of Memphis Dr. Sims, who at the last meeting was in-
structed to originate and organize measure for the sanitation of the city of Chattanooga,
and to promote them by all the means in hi power, reported that as yet nothing practica had been done The Secretary was directed to acknowledg the requests from the National Pure Food
Movement Association, and from the National
Conference of State Boards of Health, and th appointment of delegates was referred to th hxecutive Committee After examining the accounts for the pas quarter, the Board adjourned to meet on April
3,1888 Chemistry of Food and its Adulterations.
BY DANIEL F. WRIflHT, M. D So far we have considered food exclusiv with reference to its chemical constitution,
but te understand the qualities which facili-
tate its digestion and its assimilation as an or-
ganic portion of the vital tissues, to appreciat the value of different modes of combinatio and preparation, wo must give some attentio to the digestive and assimilative function in the human body The most popular treatises on digestion hav discussed the subject simply iu reference t that process of solution which food undergoe in the stomach ; but this is a very partial vie of the subject; it is only one element of foo which is modified in that way, namely th protoplasmic element, and even that has to un-
dergo further processes before its elaboratio is complete. As, therefore, the functions o the stomach are more generally known tha those of other parts of the digestive tract, w shall allude to them very briefly, and stud more in detail the processes less generall known or thought of Mastication—Theprocessesof digestion com-
mence as soon as food is admitted into th mouth, and what is done there is far from un-
important. The first of these is mastication:
this is said to be a process habitually neglecte in these United States. Our dinner is gener-
ally taken during business hours, and is looke upon by business men as a most inconvenien interruption to more important matters; tim is therefore not taken either for that deliberat attention to mastication or for the subsequen rest which is essential to the further proces of digestion. Our food is disposed of as th dog eats: it is slightly lacerated and the bolted, when a rapid retreat from the dining-
table to the office or the counting-room fol-
lows. The food therefore does not stay lon enough in the mouth to be duly prepared fo further treatment in the stomach; that orga is therefore handicapped in its efforts to per-
form its own duties. Thorough mastication i necessary for two reasons: Unless the foo undergoes thorough and minute subdivisio in that process, neither can the fluids, whic should act upon it chemically and physically,
gain access to any part of it except its surface,
nor does any other part become absorbed int the system, but passes through the intestine and is discharged unchanged—producing n effect except that of irritating the surface wit which it comes in contact. But this is not th only loss sustained through defective mastica-
tion. The motions which should be devote to this purpose are also essential to promotin the flow of saliva, and therefore bring us t our second stage in digestion—that of
Intalivalion.—Saliva is furnished by severa different glands which pour their secretion into the mouth ; two of these will be here con-
sidered. One of them, the parotid gland, fur-
nishes the saliva which mainly exerts a chem-
ical action on the food. It acts on that class,
the carbo-hydrates, such as starch and sugar,
which abound most in our breadstuff's; thes it prepares for absorption by converting the into dextrine, in which form only they can b absorbed; the other, the sublingual gland, se-
cretes a viscid fluid used for lubricating th food-mass so as to promote its passage throug the gullet to the stomach.

  p. 76 (#98)                        70
STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Now to explain the connection of thisinsal-
ivation with mastication. The duct or tub by which the saliva from the parotid gland i thrown into the mouth is embedded in th muscular tissues of the cheek ; while these ar at rest it remains closed, but the motions o mastication pressing on the duct force th saliva through it into the mouth and so fur-
nish the necessary fluid exactly as it is wanted But if these motions are abridged, the saliv which should act upon the food, remains idl in the gland. That the motions of masticatio do promote the flow of saliva any one ca prove for himself. When the mouth become dry, which it often does from sleeping wit themouth open, you have only to go through th motions of chewing to find that saliva is rapidl put forth, and the more so if a piece of leathe or india-rubber is put in the mouth to exer-
cise the teeth upon Stomach.—Supposing, now, the food-mass,
softened and moistened with saliva, and wel crushed by the teeth, to have made a safe pas-
sage through the gullet and to be received i the stomach; now commences the process t to which is ordinarily limited the term diges-
tion. Let us consider what takes place there The food materials arrive there (supposing th previous process duly performed) with th carbo-hydrates partially converted into dex-
trine, or by a further process into sugar, th fat set free from the enveloping membrane o its globules and the protoplasm not yet dis-
solved but reduced to a very fine state of sub-
division, and all very thoroughly churned u and mixed together. On entering the stomac it undergoes an elaborate series of motions;
first it is carried by the action of the circula muscular fibres by a slow spiral route fro one extremity of the stomach to the other,
coming in contact successively with every spo on its surface, and so becoming subject to se-
cretion from all the glands and follicles whic abound on that surface. These glands ar of two classes; one producing pepsin, th other gastric juice. Tne former is the activ ingredient in digestion, its function is the so-
lution of protoplasm; in other words, th muscular fibre of the meat, the casein of mil and cheese, the albumen of eggs, all these pre-
viously in a solid though minutely subdivide condition are now dissolved and become fluid This solvent power however of the gastri juice can only be performed in an acid medium,
hence the necessity of of the gastric juic which always contains acetic, and sometime muriatic acid. If by the time the food arrive at the further extremity of the stomach an portion of solid substance remains undissolved,
its contact occasions a muscular contractio at that point which carries it back to the com-
mencing point, when the whole process is re-
sumed. If solution has not yet taken plac this is again repeated, but in case masticatio has boon neglected, after the contact of undi-
gested matter has beon too often repeated, ir-
ritability is exhausted and the food passes o undigested to the intestines, doing injury ther and no good anywhere—the stomach has. i fact, finally refused to do work which ough to have been done in the mouth Duodenum.—If the previous processes hav been duly preformed, the following is the con-
dition of the food when it arrives in the intes-
tine: The sugar and starch so far as it wa dissolved in the mouth is absorbed by th blood-vessels in the stomach and so enters th circulation. Any part of it that remains un-
dissolved continues in that condition whil passing through the stomach, as the secretion there are acid and the conversion of it int the dextrine requires the presence of an alka-
line fluid—it is resumed in the intestine. Th protoplasmic elements arrive here in solution,
and the fatty or oleaginous materials, as ye unchanged except by solution of the fin membranes which enveloping them keep the apart from one another, come along floating i the other fluids in the form of globules suc as can be seen when fat is shaken up in a vis-
cid fluid. This heterogeneous mixture i called chyme; it has now to be converted int chyle. This process takes place in the firs eight or ten inches of the intestine,"which por-
tion of it is called the duodenvm. Mechanic-
ally considered, the process is an emulsion It is precisely that which is effected when i an apothecary's shop an emulsion of castor oi has to be made. He mixes his oil with gu or starch, or what is better than either, th yolk of an egg, shakes and trituates them ver thoroughly together. The result is a thic creamy looking mixture in which most of th oil has disappeared, but a little of it is stil visible in the form of smallglobulesfloating i the mass. So long as these are visible to th naked eye, and especially if they reunite an float separately on the surface, the emulsifica-
tion is not complete, and it is frequently foun difficult to bring it to perfection, but the proc-
ess can be much facilitated by the addition o a very small quantity of any alkali, as soda o potassa The process of digestion in the duodenu is similar in all its steps to this. The food, a it comes from the stomach, consists mainly (a does the mixture of castor oil and egg) of pro-
toplasm in solution mixed, but not intimately,
with an oleaginous substance in floating glob-
ules. How this is done is shown by a study o the duodenum in which it takes place. Thi portion of the intestine is mainly distinguishe from the rest of the intestinal tract by the fac of its receiving the secretions of the liver an the pancreatic gland, the bile, in short, and th pancreatic juice. The action of these two se-
cretions in digestion must be examined sepa-
rately The bile, besides other substances not no to be discussed, contains two of primary im-
portance towards digestion, viz.: A larg quantity of soda and a resinous substanc which bears special relations to oily substances The use of the first is simply expressed. The

process now required, that of rendering fatt matters capable of intimately mixing in water solutions without subsequent separation, can-
not take place in the prssence of an acid, bu it will be remembered that the juices whic act upon the food in the stomach are acid an it comes from that organ with a highly aci reaction. It is for the purpose then of neu-
tralizing this acid and rendering the.fluid al-
kaline that the soda is required. The apothe-
caries are aware of this fact, and when throug their castor oil becoming partially rancid,
acids are developed in it, they cannot make  perfect emulsion, but soon remedy the diffi-
culty by adding a very small quantity of alkali,
such as soda or potash The other ingredieut in the bile is a sort o resin which has also a powerful influence i promoting the solubility of oils. Painters i oil colors are aware of this, and put it to prac-
tical use in the form of ox-gall with whic they soften and dissolve such colors as ma have become hard and dry The combined use, then, of these two bilar ingredients is to render the fatty substance soluble, in other words, to enable them to com-
bine with albuminous substances in solution The pancreatic juice.—The gland whic furnishes this secretion is very similar i structure to those which discharge the sali-
vary secretion into the mouth. The produc of its secretion is a "clear viscid-fluid o strongly alkaline reaction, and highly coagula-
ble by heat." It seems to be the most power-
ful catalytic ferment produced in the body,
for it is capable of effecting decomposition o all the three leading alimentary substances On carbo-hydrates it continues the diastati ferment commenced by the saliva; on the fatt principles it separates the glycerine from th fatty acids, and on the protoplasmic element it effects a decomposition of part and solutio of a greater part. The constituents of thi juice, which acts on the protoplasmic princi-
ples, is called trypsin, and differs strikingl from the pepsin in the stomach. Thus pepsi acts only in presence of an acid, trypsin onl in that of an alkali; trypsin, in fact, whe mixed with pepsin and gastric juice, not onl does not exert its characteristic action but i itself digested and decomposed. Further, pep-
sin simply dissolves protoplasm, trypsin de-
composes it.
I have dwelt the more in detail on thes chemical transformations effected by the pan-
creas because it is only of late that its secre-
tion has been supposed to act on any of th food elements except the fats. It appears no that it acts with energy on all of them, and s far as we can estimate its effects on them,
which are still very obscure, its chief en seems to be to bring into the most intimat and minutely associated relation the two im-
portant elements, protoplasmic and oleaginous,
the fat and the lean. iSoue of the higher tis-
sues of the body, such as the muscles an the brain are so constructed as to dispens with both these elements in intimate combina-
tion, and an examination of the chyle, whic is the'fluid resulting from the action of th bile and pancreatic juice upon the food ele-
ments as they come' from the stomach, show that such an intimate combination has bee effected, for the fluid is found to contain  large quantity of granules which require th highest powers of the microscope for their de-
tection, out which are then shown to consis of minute particles of fat each, coated wit a pellicle of protoplasm But it is not merely a chemical and mechan-
ical action which seems to be originated in th duodenum. The phenomena of life now firs manifest themselves. It has been stated—
rather more broadly, I think, than truly, tha new nutritious material is simply dead matte and external to the organization so long as i remains in the intestinal tract. It is admitte that blood is a living constituent of the body,
but not so the fluids in the intestine. On th contrary, I contend that the characteristics o life commence their developments in the duo-
donum. It is here that cell life commences,
and that contractility, the very primary mani-
festation of vitality, exhibits itself. Here ar for the first time detected bodies exactly re-
sembling the colorless corpuscles of th blood, and here the fluid portion of the magm first becomes coagulable, forming a clot whe separated from the body, which under th microscope exhibits the same fibrinous strut -
ure as the fluid portion of the blood doe when coagulated It is true that these signs of life are mor feebly manifested in the chyle than in th blood, but they are there, and if the one flui is alive so is the other; they gain force as th chyle passes through the lacteals; the mesen-
teric glands, the thoracic duct aud its recep-
taculum, so that the corpuscles become lar-
ger and the coagulation firmer and the fibrin more abundant; but this is only a question o degree—the life begins in the duodenum It was hoped that the present paper woul complete our disquisition on the hygiene o food, but it has been found as we proceede with the subject that the philosophy of diges-
tion had to be discussed at greater length tha we anticipated in order to give a rational ac-
count of healthy methods in the preparatio and administration of food, and, as our spac is limited, we are compelled to postpone tha for another issue of the Bullktin.

els came on and death resulted Measles pre-
vailed quite extensively but in mild form; mump were also met with occasionally; and strange t say, jaundice was of as frequent occurrence as i had been for several months previous; such  prevalence of jaundice as ha* existed here for som months was never before known in the history o this county Gibson county—Dr. T.J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—As Health Officer of Gibso county, I would report a little more than an aver-
age amount of sickness for the month of January;
this is largely due to the general prevalence of ru-
beola in nearly all sections of the county. In an around Trenton the cafes are now being numbere by the score. The disease is mild in type ; only  few cases have suffered from any complications,
and those have been easily traceable to impru-
dence. In connection with rubeola, roseola als prevails, and cases of the latter are at times mis-
taken for the former. Dr. T. J. Moore, of Brad-
ford, reports measles as the prevailing disease o his neighborhood. A few cases of typhoid feve are still on hand. I have under observation on family in which, including cases now on hand,
there have been nine cases. The family was tha of a negro—a small house with only two rooms,
had hygienic surroundings, and an utter impossi-
bility to scatter the inmates—one death has occur-
red. In one white family I have two cases, no convalescing. A few cases of pneumonia are re-
ported. In my own practice I have had three

acute and chronic. The number of deaths fro zymotic diseases still shows a marked decrease Reports of physicians and others indicate a health month Chattanooga—Dr. E. A. Gobleigh, Secretary City
Board of Health.—I have to report for January  rather favorable state of municipal health. Ther is a continued predominance of diseases due t climatic vicissitudes, as catarrhs, bronchial ail-
ments, pleuritic attacks and pneumonias. Th winter also shows a persistence of hepatic, diar-
rheal and dysenteric disturbances, unusual for th season. Rheumatism, remittent fever and othe malarial disorders are occasionally met but are no of markedly frequent occurrence. A rather war but very wet winter predisposes to these types of dis-
ease existing; and tubercular cases show a genera tendency to aggravation at present. Taken all i all, January starts the new year as a pretty health one here Hancock counly—Dr. Jesse B. Mitchell, Countv

Pneumonia, bilious and malaria fevers are the other principal diseases. Taking al-
together, this month has more sickness than i common for this time of the year Obion Independent, Obion, Feb. 2, '88: Measles ha been raging in Obion county without cessation fo more than a year. It has found its way to ever nook and corner of the county, and the fatalit registered to the credit of this annoying pestilenc is astonishing and unprecedented. Especially ha this disease been fatal where the victims live i poorly arranged houses without the proper facilitie of taking care of themselves. Many who hav escaped death are left with shattered constitution and almost hopeless and debilitated and ruine health. As to how long this terrible disease wil remain among us is problematical, especially s long as the people are imprudent. Social gather-
ings of all kinds, both by day and by night, during

SUBSCRIPTION, - - - 25c PER ANNUM Entered at the Postoffioo at Nashville as Second Class
Matter Chemistry of Food and Its Adulterations.
BT DANIEt P. WRIGHT, M. D Having completed our investigation of th chemical properties of the food elements an of the processes they go through during di-
gestion, we have now to consider the form i which they are best adapted to the sustenanc of the human system. This implies the
SELECTION, PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRA-
TION Of FOOD It has already been shown that the chem-
ical constitution of food alone does not deter-
mine our conclusions on these subjects. Man,
the tiger and the ox are alike nourished wit protoplasm hydro-carbons and fatty sub-
stances, yet their food is different; the tige cannot live on grass, nor the ox on raw flesh,
nor man on either; so that the health of eac animal depends upon the form in which thes elements are presented to it. Man is th being whose food is now under consideration,
and the subject is much more complicated i his case than in that of any other animal This complication is determined by two cir-
cumstances:
1. Man is omnivorous.
2. 1 lis food requires cookery.
1. Man is omnivorous. This has been dis-
puted, and it is only within certain limitation that it is true; but practically, man in his ali-
mentary characteristics is an omnivorous ani-
mal; he is capable of applying to his nutri-
tion all those natural products which furnis food to other animals It is true that human life can be supporte on either animal or vegetable food alone, bu such is certainly not his typical or most ad-
vantageous diet. As this bus been dispute by a certain dietetic school, the.vegetarians,
we will devote some limited space to its con-
sideration. The fitness of food for the nutri-
tion of this or that animal system depend upon the proportions in which the protoplas-
mic elements and those destitute of proto-
plasm are mixed in it. Vegetable food gen-
erally contains very little protoplasm in pro-
portion to its total mass, while animal food i nearly all protoplasm except the water, whic all organic substances largely contain. Hence,
to gain a given quantity of protoplasm a muc larger quantity of vegetable than of anima food must be consumed. Since, then, all ani-
mals require for the reparation of their bodil waste nearly the same amount of protoplasm,
herbivorous animals must consume a muc greater mass of food than carnivorous, and th structure of their digestive organs differs ac-
cordingly, The ox with his capacious paunc and his four stomachs and his great length o intestines is capable of containing an immens quantity of food, while the wolf or tiger has  very simply constructed stomach and a muc shorter intestine, which can nevertheless eon-
tain enough of his food for his wants becaus the indispensable protoplasm is very muc more concentrated in his flesh diet than in th grass which fills the herbivorous stomach Now, man's digestive organs, intermediat between the two, approach much more nearl the carnivorous than the herbivorous type,
hence they cannot receive, without much in-
convenience, enough vegetable food to furnis the requisite amount of protoplasm. This i a fact I have myself had the opportunity o observing in person, having at one time board-
ed in the same house with a rigid vegetarian,
and having been astounded with the enormou quantity of bread and vegetables which h consumed, and which it took nearly the res of the day for him to digest and dispose of In short, comparative anatomy alone is quit sufficient to dispose of the vegetarian theor as a regimen for man, and the argument o that basis could be extended to much greate length if I had the time and space to devot to it On the other hand, that man can sustain lif on a purely carnivorous diet is quite true as

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
an abstract statement; that any large portio of the human race does do so, or that th whole human race could be supplied with car-
nivorous aliment in its present condition is a exceedingly doubtful proposition. It is tru that in the case of such savage tribes as liv by hunting, a very large portion of their sub-
sistence is from animal food; but with ver few even of such savages is it unmixed. The
Indians of this continent were certainly in th jjossessiun of maize and used it as food lon before the access of European nations, an the pre-historic people who inhabited the lak dwellings in Europe have left among thei reliques, so wonderfully discovered, severa species of grain stored up. If there are an known races of men who live entirely on ani-
mal food they are the Esquimaux and the Fue-
gians of the cold regions of the extreme Nort and South and the Andaman islanders, th coast tribes of which seem to live almost ex-
clusively on fish. But even the Esquimau supplement their meals of bear meat, seals'
flesh and fat with the bark of the birch an other trees ground to a sort of meal. In an case, the three races enumerated are amon the most degraded on earth The cause of the insufficiency of an absolut animal diet for human sustenance is that  much larger quantity has to be consumed tha if supplemented by some hydrocarbons, inas-
much as animal heat has to be supplied by th consumption of a large quantity of protoplas-
mic food in addition to what is used for Dod-
ily repair.
2. Mans food requires cookery. The pos-
sibility of man's subsistence for a time o some kinds of food without the agency of fir will not be disputed. Let it suffice for ou resent purpose that no race of man has ye een discovered entirely without some for of cookery. Even the cave-dwellers assigne to the interglacial periods of pre-historic geol-
ogy have left behind them heaps of burn bones, indicating their possession of fire an its use in the preparation of food. It ma moreover be shown that the art of cooker has rendered innumerable substances capabl of being used as food which must otherwis have been left for consumption by the lowe animals as incapable of digestion by hu-
man stomachs; and this limitation regardin the sources of food must have much limite the human population of the earth, leaving  sparsely scattered race of human beings il supplied with the means of competing wit the then preponderant brute creation for it means of subsistence, and itself scarcely ye advanced beyond the standard of brutal life We find ourselves again called upon to apol-
ogize for our inability to finish this course o papers in the present issue, the theoretica preliminaries having occupied an amount o space which compels us to defer to a future
Bulletin the discussion of their practical ap-
plication.

Health Officer, Winchester.—The month of Feb-
ruary was characterized by an extensive preva-
lence of measles in this place and the surroundin country. Students almost without number an whole families have suffered with the disease, bot in town and in the country. The disease has no been considered to be of a very severe form, bu perhaps an unusual number of those suffering wit it have ventured out too soon and have subse-
quently suffered, with most often lung troubles,
but in some cases with diarrhoea. The disease i still progressing without any abatement. Not  case of typhoid fever reported during the month,
nor a case of pneumonia, unconnected with mea-
sles. Two cases of jaundice in early part of month Gibson county—Dr. T.J. Happel, County Health

More than one hundred case have already occurred in the corporate limit with so far only one death. The disease so fa has been confined almost exclusively to the whit population. The later cases are more severe an show a decided tendency to complications—capil-
lary, bronchitis and pneumonia. As sequences I
have found a number of cases of otorrhea. I connnection with this epidemic of rubeola, roseol in a severe form occurs, and is in some cases mis-
taken for the former. Dr. Moore, of Bradford, re-
ports the continued spread of measles. Such a gen-
eral epidemic was never before known in West
Tennessee. Dr. J. W. Penn, of Humboldt, report health in that section unusually good. Tonsiliti is more frequent than in January. No new case of typhoid fever—one death resulted from it All cases in the negro family referred to in Janu-
ary report, have recovered. I am trying to organ-
ize a county system of health reports, but hav not succeeded well so far. Physicians do not tak the interest in such matters that they ought Milan—M. D. L. Jordan,M. D.—A few linge ing cases of measles in the country. Otherwise,

Health Officer, Waverly.—The health of our coun-
ty for the month of February has been so goo that I am almost at a loss for something to report.
A very few cases of measles, mumps, bilious, in-
termittent fever, catarrhal troubles and some rheu-
matism, all of which have been very mild, n deaths having occurred from them On receipt of the nolice from the State Board of
Health after writing the above, I went at once to-
the Knoxville College and made as full an inves-
tigation of the recent outbreak of typhoid feve as I could under existing circumstances. I regre that I did not learn of the epidemic sooner, as a earlier investigation would have been mure satis-
factory. Through the kindnessof Rev. J. S. McCuI-
loch, the worthy President, I was greatly assiste in my efforts in investigating the sanitary condi-
tion of the institution. We first directed our at-
tention to the sewers; from thence to the water-
closets and other places where effete matters wer disposed of, and lastly through one of the colleg buildings; all of which seemed to be in tirst-class.
sanitary condition. I am satisfied that the caus of the fever could not have originated from any o the above sources. Upon further inquiry, I learne that in the early part of the winter, during dr weather, the water in the cisterns became ex-
hausted, and that, unfortunately, they were re-
supplied with water from a creek, taken a shor distance below a slaughter-pen. The creek bein very low, was no doubt contaminated with putre-
faction from the pen. Contaminated water wa the most probable cause. That the cause wa local there seems to be no doubt, as all the case occurred in the college premises except one, wh went into the city and died there. I am sorr thaf a satisfactory analysis of the water could no be made. The cisterns had been emptied, excep one, in which very little water remained, and tha very much diluted with rainwater. Out of thir-
teen teachers, three look the fever, and out of on hundred and forty students, twenty-two cases oc-
curred, five resulting fatally. No new cases sinc the 2: d of February Knoxville— Dr. S.B. Boyd, City Health Officer.—

It wa about 5° lower than the February mean of las venr, but was 8° higher than that of 1886, an nearly 11° higher "than that of 1885. Th highest temperature was 71°, recorded at va-
rious stations, on the 17th, 18th and 19th, an was the lowest February maximum during th last five years except that of 1886. which was
70°. The lowest temperature was 4°, recorde on the 28th. With the exception of last yea it was the highest February minimum durin the past five years, the lowest during that tim being in 1886, when the remarkable and per-
haps unprecedented record of 22° below zer was reported. The minimum reported las year was 20° above zero, making a differenc of 42' in the February minimums of the tw years. The mean daily range was slightly les than the normal of five years There were four cold waves during th mouth, two of which came without any warn-
ing, viz: 24th-25th and 26th-28th. In bot instances—but particularly in the latter—
there was a very decided fall in temperature,
and on the last named date the lowest temper-
ature of the mouth was recorded—indeed, a several stations, the lowest of tiie winter wa reported, notably at Greeueville, Rogersville,
Knoxville, Grief, Parksville, Rugby and Chat-
tanooga, of the Eastern Division, and Riddle-
ton, of the Middle Division. The cold wave of the 7th and 11th were fully verified, but a some of the stations of the Western Divisio the warnings were reported as not being re-
ceived far enough in advance The mean rainfall was 3.45 inches, nearl two inches less than the February mean of th past five years, the greatest during that perio being 8.45 inches in 1B84, and 8.03 inches las year, and the least 2.39 iuches in 1885. O this amount the Eastern Division received a average of about four inches, the Middle Di-
vision about three and a half inches, and the
Western Division about two and a half inches The greatest monthly rainfall was 5.34 inche reported at Andersonville, and the least was
1.90 inch reported at Milan. The greates rainfall in twenty-four consecutive hours was
2.00 inches, reported on the 9th at Fostoria The days of greatest rainfall were the 3d, 7th,
10th, 11th, 19th and 24th, and of these th greatest fall occurred on the 19th. Most o the rains during the month were general,

ing The feature of the month was the thunder-
storm of the 19th, which prevailed wit greater or less severity throughout the West-
ern and Middle portions of the State and  small portion of the Eastern Division. It wa quite severe in the northern portion of the
Western Division, and the northwestern por-
tion of the Middle Division, and extende into Southwestern Kentucky, where it wa very severe. The following extracts fro some of the State papers are made:
Centerville (Hickman county) Pioneer, 24th:
During the storm last Sunday night about 9
o'clock, Mrs. Isabella Cantrell, wife of Brown
Cantrell, in Gray's Bend, was killed by light-
ning. Nothing definite as to the exact man-
ner of the occurrence can be learned, as he husband and four children, who were sleep-
ing in the same room with her, did not kno she was out of bed till they were awakened b the shook of the electricity and found th wife and mother lying with her head near th fireplace, dead. No marks or contusion wer found on her person to indicate the work o the destructive agent; every bone in her bod seemed broken. The bolt went through th roof of the house near the corner of the roo and down through the floor into the cellar Two dogs sleeping under the floor were kille by the same bolt, also a duck and a chicken Springfield Record, 23d: We learn that  terrific cyclone passed through the 17th dis-

The galvanize shutters placed on the new Christian churc liere were blown down and hurled against th idjacent house with great violence. At Pem-
broke, Ky., the storm was also unusually se-
vere, blowing down barns and houses an doing untold damage Ularksville Semi-weekly Tobacco Leaf,
21st: Sunday, the 19th inst., was the anniver-
sary of the twin storms of 1884, when a num-
ber of houses in the city were blown down,
others unroofed, and several persons injure by the falling timbers. Our people had no forgotten the terrible ordeal of that day, an the threatening indications on Sunday—th rapid changes from sunshine to shower, an the lowering elements and the rolling thunder
—recalled the former event. About 7:30 P.
M. a spring thunder storm passed over th city. This was followed by a tierce wind, ac-
companied with an exceptionally heavy fall o hail, after which a hard rain set in, but n damage of any consequence was done in th city. Other parts of the county did not es-
cape as did Clarksville, and at Lafayette, Ky.,
twenty miles northwest of here, serious dam-
age was reported. At this point the stor had the character of a tornado, sweeping ove the place in an instant, and leaving no hous in its track unscathed. Here it was apparent-
ly one-fourth of a mile wide, and nearly al evidences of it disappeared two miles from
Lafayette. It was a omit 7:40 p. M. that th quiet little town was rudely shaken up. For-
tunately the threatening elements had kep everyone in-doors, and there is no loss of lif to report, though the escapes were miraculous Great oaks that had brave the storms for years were twisted off some fee above the ground as if they had been pipe-
stems, and their bodies and tops sent whirl-
ing in the air. Several persons were more o less hurt, but no serious injuries are reported.
(Here follows list of dwellings and stores,
churches, barns, stables, and other outhouse destroyed or damaged, the losses aggregating
820,000.) Indications of the storm are re-
ported from numerous neighborhoods in th county. Alf. Darnall's tobacco barn on
Blooming Grove was blown down. At St Bethlehem, Sam Jackson's barns were blow down, as were Mrs. Hatcher's stables, killin several cows. A barn containing 20oii0
pounds of tobacco, belonging to Mr. Clark at
Pembroke, was blown down, and two bani were overturned north of Port Royal. At
Bennettstown, Ky., several miles from Lafay-
ette, the storm was very severe. The light-
ning struck and burned a barn near Sadlers-
ville Sunday morning Thunderstorms were reported as follows:

SUBSCRIPTION. - - - 25c PER ANNUM Entered at the Postoffice at Nashville as Second Class
M attar The Uniled States Cholera Commissioner In midsummer, 1884. Asiatic cholera startle all Europe and America by a sudden and terrifi outbreak in southern France. Travel stopped;
commerce was interrupted, and great money losseB
incurred. Throughout the great valley of the
Mississippi, which is the United States, less tw ocean friuges, the keenest interest was felt in it firogre&o. Hopes at first prevailed that such en-
ightened governments as those of France, Spai and Italy were in line with modern sanitary prog-
ress, and that the epidemic would be confined to  small area. These hopes proved baseless. Upo trial the people, and the rulers especially, of
Spain and Italy proved utterly unfit for the emer-
gency. Hence in 1885, Spain and Italy were i some portions dreadfully scourged, and becam the scenes of a panic, terror and a misery unlooke for in the last quarter of the much lauded nine-
teenth century Qiving heed to the general wish of the people,
the American government determined to investi-
gate the cholera in Europe. In the autumn of
1886, Dr. Edward O. Shakespeare, of Philadel-
phia; was appointed as this most important com-
mission. The Journal of the American Med-
ical Association, October 10, 1885, says: "Th appointment reflects great credit on the govern-
ment."
Dr. Shakespeare's progress has been watched b this board with lively interest from that date t the present. In the Bulletin for December,
1886, attention was called to his suggestio as follows:
"early recognition of cholera Dr. E. O. Shakespeare, who some months ag was appointed bv the United States Governmen to go abroad and investigate the subject of cholera,
recently in a lecture before the College of Physi-
cians of Phildelphia, is reported as having mad the following statement, which every medica man, but especially every officer of health, shoul bear in mind, and be prepared upon the shortes notice to intelligently apply the test suggested,
should occasion arise. He said: 'Although th proof of the statement that the comma-bacillus i the active and efficient cause of cholera Asialica wa not entirely satisfactory to his mind, the lecture felt no hesitation in declaring that Koch had con-
ferred an inestimable boon upon the race b placing in the hands of every practitioner au in-
fallible means of diagnosis of this disease fro cholera morbus and other diseases resembling chol-
era. He expressed the opinion that a health office or physician who, in the presence of suspected cases an be, ore the prevalence of the malady as an epidemic,
should Jail lo employ this means of deciding whether o not the disease is genuine cholera, would be guilty o criminal negligence.'"
Desiring full information as to the practica details so far as the same could be simplified fo applying this test, the President sent the followin letter:
Tennessee State Board of Health,
Nashville, May 3,1887 Dr. E. O. Shakespeare,
Philadelphia. Pa Dear Sir:—By to-days mail I send you  marked copy of December Bulletin. That th greatest good may be made to follow your sugges-
tion therein alluded to, I have determined to ask
—if it be not too much—that you prepare fo publication in Bulletin, specific direction?,
brief but clear, as to the mode of procedure, ste by step, etc., in detecting the comma-bacillus; th same to be carried out by the average practitione of medicine, or health officer, in the event of  suspicious "first" case of cholera occurring in
Tennessee during the approaching season. Th great value of early differentiation of cholera Asi-
atics from cholera morbus, etc., cannot be over-es-
timated, and if the means to that end can be s simplified that an average practitioner can appl successfully the same, a great work will indee have been accomplished. Trusting that you ma consider favorably the request made, I am, sir,
with great respect, Your obedient servant,
J. D. Plunkkt.

EALTH BULLETIN No reply was received, and as two meetings o the American Public Health Association hav transpired, nt which were gathered the Health
Officers of the continent, and other prominent san-
tar ans, and no intimation was given of his obser-
vations, and as up to now no official reports hav been published, so far as we know, the questio naturally arises in our mind: Why, if E. 0 Sliakespeare, M. D., is not a mylh, have hi obervations upon cholera, if they hud any rea value or special interest to the American public,
been so long delayed in their publication?

Officer, Athens.—We are in the midst of the mos severe epidemic of measles we ever witnessed ; th peculiarity is that as soon as the eruption disip-
pears pneumonia sets in, and then the fight fo life begins in earnest. In most of the cases the ex-
pectoration is enormously large. Typhoid symp-
toms frequently supervene, the bowels becom tympanitic, with a tendency to colliquative diar-
rhce. Some deaths have occurred, but taking int account the gravity of the symptoms, the percent-
age of deaths has been small. Qtiiniaand whisk are undoubtedly our best remedies. Have ha measles here for more than a year. Hope it i giving us a parting kick. Nothing further of im-

Castalian Springs, Tenn., writes to the City Boar of Health here to know what the law is regardin the shipment of diseased hogs to the markets Hurst intimates that certain parties in his localit have been shipping diseased hogs to Louisvill and other markets. The matter has been referre to the State Board of Health."
President I'lunket immediately addressed a not of inquiry to the Health Officer of Sumner county,
calling for the facts in this case. The following i the reply received:
"Yoursof the 29th ult. received, and I have mad the inquiry concerning the matter referred to, an will give you the result:
"1. I saw Mr. Harsh, who wrote the letter t the Louisville Board of Health, and he says h wrote it for information ; that it had been the prac-
tice of some farmers to ship hogs as soon as an disease broke out in their stock. It seems to hav been done some year or so ago.
"2. I have made inquiry and find that there i no disease among the hogs now prevailing else-
where in Sumner, nor near Castalian Springs."

BY DANIEL F. WEIGHT, M. D Non-Nitrogenous Bodies.—The prelimi-
nary considerations on which the practical foo question is based have unavoidably been pu forward in a very intermittent manner, an the amount of matter that could be given i one number of the Bulletin has been s small, on account of our limitations as regard space, that we fear the whole subject has as-
sumed a disjointed character not favorable t elear conceptions of the argument. We pro-
ceed, however, to the best of our ability, t give the practical conclusions for which thes theoretical papers were intended to be prelim-
inary. We find, however, that this will occup several papers, and can not be confined to th present one, as was anticipated in our las number. The subject expands before us a we go on, and we can not at present assign an limits to it Bread-stuffs.—So essential a part of huma food is bread, that the word has, by a natura metonymy, come to be used for food in gen-
eral, and when we are taught to pray for ou daily bread, we understand it as expressin our dependence on Divine bounty for all tha constitutes the sustenance of the human body We are here, however, considering speciall the food products of the various cereal grains,
and its sanitary relations. Of these the mos universally in use is wheat, and wheal brea will be selected as the typical form of farina-
ceous food. The materials of bread have bee shown to be mainly starch and gluten, o which the former represents the hydro-carbo and the latter the protoplasm. We shal mainly treat of it here as starch, reserving^ th protoplasmic principle till we treat of it a contained in animal food. The starch i largely predominant in bread, the protoplas iu meat. -
Bread differs from meat in this importan respect, that it requires a chemical chang from starch to glucose before it can be nutri-
tious, while meat is already, prior to digestion,
in a condition for nutriment, without chem-
ical change. Hence, bread, contrary to gen-
eral opinion, requires more digestion tha meat. Moreover, as it has beep shown tha the saliva is a principal agent in its transform-
ation, mastication is even more important tha in the case of animal food. Now the form i which bread is generally furnished at our to-
bies is very unfavorable to mastication; w get it hot from the oven, in which condition i will not crumble, and mastication fails alto-
gether to break up its texture; there is non of the minute subdivision which has bee shown to be necessary for its digestion. Th bread ought to be eaten about the third da after baking, never earlier than the second It should also be thoroughly baked, as  doughy condition is equally fatal to its minut subdivision. Moreover, this comminution o particles is most thoroughly maintained whe a moderate quantity of oleaginous substance i masticated with it (not in a liquid condition),
such as butter or animal fat; without this th masticated mass is liable to consolidate again But here the objection to hot bread come in again. The most contrary to all hygieni principles is the hot buttered roll of a luxur-
ious breakfast; here the bread is hardly mas-
ticated at all, but goes to the stomach as  mass of dough, while the butter, squeezed ou of it, goes down in the form of a semi-flui oil, no combination being effected at all As bread, when not used as an accompani-
ment of animal food, always means bread an butter among English speaking people, it ma be well to say a word in behalf of the thi bread and butter of the English tea-table a the most sanitary form in which the two arti-
cles can be combined. Strange to say, it is al-
most unknown on our tables. The conse-
quence is that all the conditions of preparin sanitary bread have to be considered befor we can understand what constitutes an Englis plate of bread and butter. 1. The bread mus bo well leavened ("salt rising" bread won' do; it can't be kept long enough). 2. Th joaves must be large enough not to get too dr in the time of keeping required for health.
3. It should not be eaten until the second, o preferably, the third day after baking. 4. T prepare for the table, a slice of the crust

should first be cut off with a sharp knife, an the butter spread on the exposed surface, be-
ing in winter slightly softened but not liquifie by heat. A slice so spread is then cut of about the eighth of an inch thick, and the ex-
posed surface treated as before for a secon slice, the process being continued till enoug is prepared for the meal; the slices are lai like shingles over one another on the dish, an the bread and butter is ready for the table This seems like petty trifling in a grave sani-
tary treatise, but, until I can see a plate of
English bread and butter on an American ta-
ble, I shall not be convinced that hygiene ha made its way to our breakfast and supper ta-
bles. There is no other way in which the tw great elements of food can be so adequatel prepared for perfect incorporation in the pro-
cess of mastication, and the simple dish of
"bread and butter" is put forward as a typica form for the healthy combination of amyla-
ceous and oleaginous food In the making of the bread two things hav to be provided for: 1. The inclusion in th flour of all the nutritious elements of th wheat; and, 2. The aeration of the dough An important element is lost when th wheat is ground by ordinary methods. Thi is the eerealine, an important element whic exists in the grain only immediately under th thin skin and generally goes with the bran, s that the cows really get the best part of th wheat; this is saved in the flour by an im-
proved method of grinding which takes off th skin without detaching the eerealine. Th subsequent grinding then produces a flou which contains all the nutritious principle of the wheat, including starch, glutine an eerealine. This flour has been denominate whole Jlour But flour so made is not white if any leave or ferment is used with it; the ferment de-
composes the eerealine and thereby deprive it of much of its nutritive value, at the sam time that it causes it to discolor the bread This may be avoided by changing the proces for aerating the bread Aeration is the process by which the doug is made to assume a spongy consistency throug the formation of innumerable air bubbles i its substance; the smaller and more numer-
ous these are and the more evenly disperse through its substance the more perfect is th aeration. This is generally effected by fer-
mentation, which is not, however, either th most healthy or the most economical method;
for in whatever way fermentation is brough about it consists in the decomposition of som part of the flour so as to generate carboni gas from it, so that the bubbles above de-
scribed are not really air bubbles, but ga bubbles. Now fermentation, to say the bes of it, is a wasteful process; it acta by the in-
troduction into the mass of the dough of  small quantity of a substance which is under-
going decomposition; this tendency to decom-
position is communicated to the dough itself,
and by decomposing part of it, supplies th gas which aerates the rest. But the par which is decomposed is lost for all purpose of nutrition. Nor is this loss all the objec-
tion to ferments. The substances used fo starting the process are not always in a sani-
tary condition; they are found sometimes t be undergoing the acetic instead of the alco-
holic fermentation, and then they excite  similar action in the dough mass which pro-
duces sour bread The remedy tor all this is the process fo introducing the carbonic gas from withou instead of generating it within the bread b means of a ferment. This is the metho invented in 1859 by the German physician Dr. Dauglish: The carbonic gas is generate in a strong vessel, exactly on the same princi-
ple as that on which it is prepared for sod founts, and forced through the substance o the dough by pressure from an air-pump. I has been in use ever since in large cities, bot in Europe and America, with excellent re-
sults. It not only produces a better an cheaper bread, but it is a cleanlier process,
the baker's hands not coming in contact wit the bread at all. It is moreover healthier,
for the bakers, who suffer impaired healt under the present system through inhalin the flour into their lungs. Of course this pro-
cess cannot be carried on in private families,
as it implies an extensive apparatus only fitte for large establishments; but every conside-
rable city ought to sustain a baking establish-
ment using whole flour, and working the Dau-
glish aerating apparatus, with profit, especiall if the public were duly enlightened on th system The importance of the bread question can-
not be exaggerated. Healthy bread is no only of great sanitary value itself, but as  concomitant of all other viands it assists i promoting their digestion as well as furnish-
ing a digestible and nutritious article of die in itself As we endeavored to show in th familiar instance of bread and butter, that th bread helps to digest the butter and the but-
ter the bread, so good bread in combinatio with meat, with sugar, in short with all kind of food, helps to make them digestible b promoting and maintaining that minute sub-
division and combination of heterogeneou particles which we have shown to be an essen-
tial condition of digestion But to do all this in perfection, brea should possess the following qualities:
1. It should contain all the proximat principles of the wheat.
2. It should contain nothing else but the and water.
3. It should be light, or in other word well aerated.
4. It should be not so new when eaten a to he incapable of crumbling in the process o mastication.

REPORT FOR MARCH, 1888 The month of March, with the exception o the first decade had the usual features of hig winds, electric storms, and, in many sections,
an abnormally great rainfall. Altogether, i was a very disagreeable month The mean temperature was 46º. 7, about the
March average for the past six years. Th highest temperature was 80°.5, recorded o the 31st,and was only half a degree below th highest March maximum during the past si years. The lowest temperature was 12°, record-
ed on the 23d, and was 6° below the March mi imum of last year, and 7° above that of 1885 The mean daily range of temperature wa about the normal. The highest temperature were recorded on the 18th, 20th and 31st, an the lowest on the 8th and 11th, in the Middl and Western divisions, and on the 23d, i the Eastern division. Cold-wave warning were received on the 2d, 16th, 19th, 26th and
27th, and were verified except that of the 16t at Fayetteville and Gallatin, in the Middl division, and Mason, in the Western division,
that of the 19th at at Mason, and that of the
26th at Fayetteville The mean precipitation was 6.02 inches,
which was about an inch above the Marc mean for the past six years, but nearly tw inches less than that in 1884. Of this amount,
the Eastern division received an average o four and three-fourths inches, the Middl division seven inches, and the Wester division nearly six inches. The greater portio of the rain fell during the five days from the
25th to the 29th, inclusive. The rain of the
25th-26th, was one of the greatest known in

io the State, an average depth of 2.32 inche bein§ recorded for the entire State. In man localities, this was the greatest ever known,
and was very destructive to fences along th water-courses, and to plowed lands. The rain-
fall was particularly heavy in the wester portion of the Middle division, and man great local daily falls were reported, notabl at Lawrenceburg. where a fall of 4.71 inche was recorded, for the twenty-four consecutiv hours ending on the 26th ; at Nunnelly, 4.01
inches; at Ashwood, 3.58 inches; at Hohen-
wald, 3.52 inches; and at Savannah, 3.22
inches. In other portions of the Middl division were heavy falls, as at Fayetteville,
3.23 inches; Cookeville, 3.00 inches; Fostoria,
3.58 inches; Watkins. 2.50 inches; and at
Kingston Springs. 2.40 inches. The greatest,
monthly fall was 9.90 inches, reported at Law-
renceburg, and the least was 2.12 inches,
reported at Jonesboro. The 10th, 20th, 27t and 28th were also days of heavy rainfall Most of the rains were general, and those o the 5th, 11th and 22d were accompanied wit snow, in the Eastern and Middle divisions The 1st. 7th, 8th, 9th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 18th,
23d and 31st were reported without measur-
able precipitation. Snow fell at most of th stations in the State, but mostly in the East-
ern division; the greatest depth reported was
1.75 inch, at Newport. At many places th fall was very light, not sufficient to measure Frosts were reported on 21 days, the 1st to
4th, 17th.24th to 28th being reported free fro frost. The frosts of the 8th, 11th, 12th, 15th,
16th and 23d were heavy, the others generall light. Hail fell in a few localities on the
20th, 26th and 27th. In the southern por-
tions of Gibson county on the 20th, the hail-
stones were reported as large as marbles; wha size marbles the reporter did not state The percentage of verifications of weathe and temperature predictions sent from the

Eastern division, in Blount county, and in
Loudon and Knox counties, near the line o the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Rail-

Nashville, April 24, 1888 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President Slate Board of Health:
Sir—One of the most practical steps lately ta-
ken for the prevention of the spread of epidemi diseases, is the agreement or compact entered int at Toronto, October 6th, 1886, by the International
Conference of State Boards of Health, and als adopted by the American Public Health Associa-
tion, on October 8th, 1886 The State Board of Tennessee was fully repre-
sented at these conferences, and has faithfull complied with the obligations then and there in-
curred, which can be best understood by a stud of the resolutions adopted.
"Whereas, It is necessary for the protectio and preservation of the public health that promp information should be given of the existence o cholera, yellow fever and small-pox; be it
1. Resolved, That it is the sense of the National
Conference of State Boards of Health that it i the duty of each state, provincial and local boar of health in any locality in which said disease may at any time occnr, to furnish immediatel information of the existence of such diseases t boards of health of neighboring and provincia states, and to the local board in such states a have no state board.

In pursuance with the above resolutions, the
State Board of Health of Tennessee has durin the last quarter been notified of the presence o small-pox in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine,
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinoi and Louisiana So soon as the case of small-pox occurred at
Jackson, in this state, notice was at once sent t all the state boards of health in the Union and
Dominion Sanitarians in the United States are now quite

uneasy about a threatened outbreak of small-pox Not without reason; for so far as prophylaxis b universal vaccination is concerned, the depend-
ence is upon a broken reed. Very few communi-
ties in America are properly guarded in this re-
spect. We must rely upon isolation and disin-
fection in each individual case to prevent its rapi spread and consequent immense damage to th neighborhood in which it may occur. Hence th vital importance that prompt and reliable inform-
ation should at once be given to local and stat health authorities, so that efficient steps may b taken to stamp out this loathesome pest As to small-pox, Tennessee should never rela extreme vigilance. Eight great lines of railwa traverse the state, with numerous branches no penetrating its remote recesses. New lines are unde way in all portions of the state, employing larg bodies of laborers, mostly from abroad. W should be prepared at any time to hear that im-
ported cases of small-pox exist in any one of ou ninety-six counties. The majority of these coun-
ties are working in harmony with the ttate boar of health, as by law required, and are ready t comply with its regulations for speedily stampin out this and all infectious diseases. It is to b much regretted that several counties yet ignor the statute on this important subject There is no excuse for this lethargy, for withi the present decade epidemics of small-pox alon have cost the authorities of only seven countie the large sum of SI41,616.91, a,s shown by item in the Bulletin, Vol. II, page 69, besides grea damage to business and life. If lull statistic could have been obtained, the aggregate woul doubtless have been more than doubled. Onl the other day Park Marshal, Esq., of Franklin,
furnished me with the cost of small-pox in Wil-
liamson county, from the official records: In 1882,
$1,882.22; in 1883, $3,824.05; total, $5,700.27 The corporation of Franklin also incurred som expenses. There were some fifty to seventy-fiv cases Contrast this experience with that of Jackson,
as reported in the Bulletin, March and Apri numbers. Here a prompt county health official,
acting according to law, at once reports to th state board and calls upon the local authoritie for means to carry out the rules and regulation of that board. The afflicted persons are wel cared for and recovered, the public is not alarmed,
the disease does not spread, and the tax-paye foots no thousands Dr. Henry B. Baker, in a recent very minut and thorough study of epidemics of diphtheria in
Michigan, demonstrates most conclusively tha the formula now adopted as an axiom by sanita-
rians for the prevention of the spread of epidemi diseases may be relied upon; to-wit: isolatio and disinfection The following additions have been made to th library since my last report:

tral Bureau of Public Health, possessed of am-
ple authority and funds, which shall gathe together at short intervals of time and prop-
erly interpret the mortality and morbility sta-
tistics as may be supplied by these severa state and municipal boards, and which shal furnish reliable information regularly of epi-
demic diseases as they may prevail in foreig countries, and give timely warning of the ap-
proach to or arrival upon the shores of Amer-
ica of any epidemic diseases, and which shal especially, be charged with the duty of inves-
tigating the ultimate cause of all communica-
ble diseases, and the best means of preventin both the origin and spread of the same; there-

about 9.30 o'clock. No particular damage wa done. The hail was so heavy as to beat som of the leaves from the trees, and perforate them like shot from a gun. During the stor the people in this section were treated t something that is seldom seen in the south—
that is, globular lightning Lynnville, April 23—A very heavy rai fell last night about midnight. The wind fo a short time blew furiously. Quite a hailstor prevailed a few miles northeast. Rain was be-

Matter-
Look Out Simultaneously though "a long ways apart,"
there developed in Memphis upon May 19,
two foci of small-pox infection, and fro these foci there have occurred already nin other cases of small-pox, making a total o eleven up to this writing. There is no evi-
dence to show that the first cases had a com-
mon origin or were in any remote way con-
nected one with the other, but on the con-
trary. A condition of things which may an day be duplicated in any railroad or rive town in Tennessee. The simple statement o fact as given should be enough to arrest th attention of every practitioner of medicine i the State and cause him to urge, where it ha not successfully been done before, the imme-
diate vaccination of each member of eac family or individual whose medical adviser h may be. For in vaccination lies our greates protection. But especially should the an-
nouncement stimulate to the greatest vigi-
lance every health officer, municipal an county, so that at the earliest possible mo-
ment after the appearance of this deadly an loathsome disease within his jurisdiction h may enforce rigid isolation and disinfection,
together with the other "rules and regula-
tions" of this board prescribed for the restric-
tion and prevention of small-pox. The tid of immigration which, during the last two o three years, has so decidedly set in toward
Tennessee, has increased many fold the trave of strangers upon all the net work of railroad which now ramify the different sections of th state, and has, as a consequence, greatly in-
creased the danger to the public health o our commonwealth by reason of the more fre-
quent importation into our midst of infectiou and contagious diseases, at the head of whic at this time we may place small-pox. Henc the responsibility and duty of the health of-
ficer has been and is being rapidly increase in many directions and ways, and it behoove him to fully recognize the fact and to act ac-
cordingly.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Failed to Notify It is with regret we note the fact that the
State Board of Health of Missouri has faile to comply with the agreement entered into a the meeting of the International Conference
.if State Boards of Health, held at Toronto,
October 6,1886, which provides " that promp information should be given of the existenc of cholera, yellow fever and small-pox." I the printed statement of mortality for th month ending May 31,1888, of the Health
Department of St. Louis, received by thi board June 13, we find as a footnote the fol-
lowing:
"During the month seventeen cases of small-
pox were taken from the city to the Small-
pox Hospital." How many other cases oc-
curred before or have occurred since in St Louis, or how many other towns in the stat are now or recently have been infected wit this disease, we have no information. No no-
tice has been received regarding these fact from the Missouri State Board of Health Small-pox Keported to the State Board of

Bledsoe county—Dr. J as. A. Ross, County
Health Officer, Pikeville.—No report received Blount county —Dr. Jno. P. Biankenship, County
Health Officer, Maryville.—The following dis-
eases prevailed in tliis county during May: Bil-
ious attacks, dysentery in a mild form, measles
(scattering cases), mumps, pneumonia, and th usual amount of catarrhal troubles. Death rat is low. The past three months have been heal-
thier than usual for this season of the year Bradley county—Dr. L. V. Brown, County
Health Officer, Cleveland.—During the month
"f May we had a few cases of dysentery reported There are a number of children who have suffere more or less with diarrhoea and intestinal irrita-
tion. Some two or three well marked cases o cholera-niorbus have been observed Campbell county —Dr. J. H. Agee, County
Health Officer, Jacksboro.— Health of the count lias been good. Some few cases of typhoid feve in some localities. Some few cases of pneumonia
(ever and a few cases of meningitis among chil-
dren Cannon county — Dr. II. M. I learn, County

vere case of rheumatism on north side of county,
which is still lingering and doubtful Carroll county—Dr. J. L. Murray, County

W. Booth, Secretary, City Board of Health.—
With the exception of fome bowel troubles, I
have no sickness to report Crockett county —Dr. H W. Cooke, County
Health Officer, Alamo.—Health was never bette in this county than now. Physicians have bu little to do. Have had some good rains, but as  rule, the weather has been dry throughout th county Cumberland county —Dr. 8. J. Murray, County
Health Officer, Pomona.—Nosickness during Ma of any consequence. A little indisposition an one case of pneumonia are all I have to report Davidson county—Dr. W. C. Cook, County
Health Officer, Nashville.—Davidson county i entirely free from all infectious diseases thi month, as far as reports show, aud indeed there i freedom from all kinds of sickness. Our sanitar officers keep up constant, daily house to house in-
spection—secure abatement of every character o nuisances promptly, and hence the sanitary con-
dition of the county is about all that can be de-
sired Nashville—Dr. Chas. Mitchell,City Health Officer An especially low death record for month of May The prevailing diseases for the month wer diarrheal diseases and typhoid and malaria fevers. A few scattering cases of scarlet feve and measles were reported during the month, wit one death from each. There was some excite-
ment and alarm created in East Nashville durin the latter part of the month by a rumor that  malignant type of ''spotted fever" or cerebr spinal meningitis, had broken out in that sectio of the city. As is usual in such cases, the rumor were very much exagerated. There were fou cases (three of them fatal) all told, and thes were confined to two families of a tubercula diathesis. I made a careful inspection of th premises and neighborhood in person, and foun the premises of every one in an excellent sanitar condition The first case appeared about May 20,
and the last one about rive days after. If a epidemic was threatening we certainly woul have had other cases ere this. I am therefore in-
clined to give the individual diathesis and sus-
ceptibility special significance in looking for  solution to the problem Decatur county—Dr. J. F. Aydelott, County
Health Officer, Decalurville.—Sickness has bee unusually prevalent for the season. More sick-
ness this April and May than for the correspond-
ing months of any year for ten years past. Th diseases were typhoid fever, pneumonia, measles,
roseola, whooping-cough and croup. Sickness ha not been very fatal, but exceedingly stubborn. A
few deaths among children and old people. Sick-
ness has abated some DeKalb county—Dr. M. L. Wilson, County
Health Officer, Smithville.—No report received Dickson county.—No board organized Dyer county—Dr. J. P. C. Walker, County
Health Officer, Dyersburg.—No report received Dyersburg—Dr. H. F. Ferguson, President;
Dr. F. Summers, Secretary, City Board of Health.
—No report received Fayette county—Dr. W. A. Ealy, County Health
Officer, Somerville.—No report received Fentress county—Dr. J. Bertram, County Health
Officer, Little Crab.— I have to report a great dea of catarrhal trouble, and roseola. Several case of whooping-cough. Five cases of typho-malaria fever. Two deaths Franklin county—Dr. J.C. Shapard, County Health
Officer, Winchester.—During Iday there were  few cases of measles, but that is evidently sub-
siding. The same may be said of mumps, whic have been so prevalent. Aftej- long suffering, a old man died a day or so ago with jaundice,
which closed out the most remarkable epidemi of that disease ever known in this county. Dur-
ing the last few days there have been a few mil cases of dysentery in the county, which woul now seem to be the coming disease Gibson county—Dr. T. .1. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—The month of May was unus-
ually healthy. So little sickness Iims been that I
have reports from on\# two points in the county Dr. A. B. Clay reports from Rutherford little o no sickness, with two deaths ; one, pneumonia, age
75; one, cause unknown. Dr. Caldwell, of Me-
dina, reports no prevailing type of disease. Ton-
silitis has been more prevalent in and around

mediately moved to the small-pox hospital, an the houses, with the furnilure, thoroughly disin-
fected with the bi-chloride solution, one part t one thousand of water, as recommended by the
Louisiana Board of Health, and then the fume of sulphur. As these two cases had existed fo nearly a week, I could hardly expect to stam out the disease immediately, as the infection hu evidently gotten out before we discovered th cases. However, every precaution was imme-
diately taken to prevent further spread, and  public vaccinator was put to work as soon as  supply of fresh vaccine could be obtained. Thi vaccinator, Dr. S. P. Greene, is still at work On June 3d two cases were discovered in th neighborhood of the Greenlaw-street cases, both o which were sent to the hospital. On the 8th on was discovered on Monroe street, in immediat vicinity of first case there; sent to hospital. On other case I neglected in the above. Saturday,

I look for more cases to de-
velop yet, but at this time there is no case in th city and none in the county that I know of out-
side of the hospital. I do not anticipate any se-
rious spread, and will keep you informed.

"July, August, and September are the wors months, and the " second year " the dreaded per-
iod of the child's life. As preventative measures,
are recommended: 1. The nursing of the chil over the second summer, when this can lie prop-
erly done, if her milk agrees with the child, an the mother is not exhausted. '2. The wearing of
I thin flannel shirt by the child all through th summer. It should be thin, and in hot weathe toy thin. 3. Feeding only milk or other foo known to be fresh,and absolutely pure. 4. When-
ever possible, babies should spend the summe months in the country. If the above precaution could always be carried out, summer complain would be almost unknown. With care, the dis-
ease can be greatly diminished. At all events,
(luring the summer months, give the child pur water to drink at frequent intervals, for it need water to supply that lost by the perspiration Bathe it in cool or tepid water twice a day. Kee it in the ojien air as much as possible and wher llie air is pure. Don't permit it to have any sour,
unripe, over-ripe, or half decayed fruits. Eve ripe fruit may cause injury if the child be allowe to indulge at will.
A very frequent cause of the early death o y.iiinj! children is improper feeiiing. The natura food for babies is tbe breast milk of its ow mother, next that of a wet nurse; lastly, unskim-
med cow's milk or goat's milk; the latter is ver nourishing and easily digested. For young babie remember that milk and milk only should be use as food. They need no gruel, butter, honey o castor oil ; these things are all worse than useless
—they are dangerous. Too much care cannot b exercised to secure pure milk It is now believe that milk derived from a number of cows is bette than that from one cow. If from one cow, car should be taken not to get it from a cow whic has been milking too long, since milk frequentl deteriorates from this cause; also, when the mil disagrees with the child, it will be well to chang the cow. As soon as the milk is received, i should be placed on the stove and brought to  boil, then placed in the coolest place—on ice or i the well. The vessel in which the milk is kep should daily be scalded out with boiling wate and cleaned with soap, being kept perfectly pur and sweet. Earthen or glass or stone-ware vessel are preferable to tin ones for keeping milk in Never gii'e a baby sour or musty milk; it must alway be sweet and pure, and freshly prepared eac time; if sour, throw it away and get some fresh;
it cannot be safely sweetened. When fed to th child, the milk should be diluted with one fourt or less water, and a little sugar added ; but befor you add water, be sure that the milkman has no previously added it. If the undiluted mil agrees with the child, use it. Use "condense milk " if the fresh cannot be had pure. Unde six months, children can be stuffed with, but no nourished by, corn, flour, arrowroot, baked Hou and all other kinds of starchy foods. These ar of no value at all to children under six months,
and they may be and often are starved to deat on these things
WheTe the child has cut its front teeth, it shoul have some light food, as bread, baked flour o milk biscuits added to its milk. Once .a day, i may have meat, broth or beef tea, with bread o biscuits soaked in it—or the yolk of an egg lightl boiled. When ii is a year and a half old, it ma have some fine chopped meat, but milk shoul still be its principal food. At two years, it ma ent of corn meal mush, rolled wheat, oat grits,
etc., but such food as solid meat and potatoes,
fat pork and (isli. which form the food of adults,
should on no account be given to babies. Do no give any of the patented baby foods sold at th stores, unless on Me adtice of your family physician Creeping and crawling children must not be per-
mitted to pick up unwholesome food The nursing bottle needs special attention. I should be oval, with no corners or rough place in which the milk may lodge and become sour.
A plain black rubber nipple to slip over the mout of the bottle is the best pattern. Never use th elaborate and complex nipples with glass an rubber lubes attached, because they cannot b readily cleansed ; and they also invite in the bab the habit of sleeping with the nipple in the mouth,
a thing which should never happen. Both bottl and nipple should be thoroughly cleansed in boil-
ing water after each using, and then kept in col water to which a little baking soda has bee added, until used again.—[Pennsylvania State Boar of Health..]

EEPOBT IFOIR, IMTA "Y, 1888 The meteorological conditions for Ma show but few departures from the normal o the past six years. The principal feature wa the period of low temperature about the 15th.
culminating in a heavy frost in most parts o the State. There were no very high winds,
and only one severe electric storm, which wa rather local in its character, except as to th rain accompanying it. The percentage o cloudiness was above the normal The mean temperature was 65°.7, ver nearly the normal for the past six years. Th highest local mean was 70°.2, recorded at
Bolivar, and the lowest 603.3, recorded at
Fostoria. The highest temperature was 90°.0,
recorded on the 20th, and was the lowest
May maximum recorded during the past si years, except in 1884, when it was the same,
the highest being 04°.() in 1885. The lowest,
temperature was 30°.0, recorded on the 15th,
and was the lowest by three degrees durin the period named, and the same as the Apri minimum. The days on which the maximu temperature was recorded were the 11th, 2o'th,
27th and 28th. The minimum temperatur was recorded on the 15th, generally in th eastern and middle divisions, and on the 1st,
2d and 14th in the western division, and at  few stations in the middle division. Th daily ranges of temperature were very nearl the normal The mean precipitation was 3.72 inches,
slightly below the May mean for the past si years, and the least during that period, excep in 1884 and 1887. Of this amount, the east-
ern division received an average of nearl five and a half inches, the middle division  little more than three inches, and the wester division about two and a half inches. Th rains during the month were at most of th stations frequent, but generally light, th heaviest fall being reported at Chattanoog on the .'50th, measuring 2.45 inches; the nex heaviest was 1.70 inch, reported at lliddle-
ton on the 24th, 1.68 inch at Parksvill on the 31st, and 1.G5 inch at Fayettcville o the 18th. The rain of the 24th at Trento was perhaps the heaviest in the state durin the month. 1.45 inch falling in one hour There were a few other stations where mor than an inch of rain in twenty-four consecu-
tive hours was reported. The frequency o the rains in various parUs of the state can b imagined from the fact that only two day during the month were reported as withou measurable rainfall at any of the stations,
and on one of these a trace or sprinkle wa recorded. These days were the 26th and 27th The greatest monthly rainfall was 8.00 inche reported at Newport, and the least, 1.90 inc at Milan. Hail fell at a few stations. Dew were reported at various stations on eightee days, and frosts on four days, the last, on the
15th, being a killing frost at many stations,
especially in the eastern and middle divisions The percentage of verifications of weathe and temperature predictions sent daily fro the Signal Office at Washington, to the various
.stations in the state, were for the state:

Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, July 3, 1888 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health:
Sir—In my last report I called special attentio to the indifference pervading the medical profes-
sion and the general public in regard to the timel prevention oi sniall-pox. From extensive trave and conversation in all portions of Tennessee, th conclusion is evident that a large majority of ou people are not protected against liability to thi loathsome disease so far as the recognized prophy-
lactic of a hundred years experience is concerned In the last four years, one of the principal dru houses which makes a specialty of keeping th best vaccine virus, reports sales amounting to si hundred dollars. Perhaps this represents half th entire amount used in Tennessee during the pas four years When the condition of the large African popu-
lation, crowded into our cities and towns is take into consideration, it is evident that just now, de-
pendence upon vaccination is leaning upon  broken reed Prompt isolation and absolute disinfection mus be our first reliance; health officers and physi-
cians must be wide awake. Upon the County
Courts rests a very heavy responsibility. Thes bodies have the power and the means for preven-
tive measures. By prompt action thousands upo thousands of dollars may be saved, and terrorizin alarms prevented The notification of the existence of small-po in adjoining and distant states caused the Execu-
tive Committee to order a large edition of the
June Bulletin, and of the pamphlet giving in-
structions for the management of small-pox, shoul it appear in any neighborhood. These document have been circulated with systematic care in ever nook and corner of the State, and thus all con-
cerned put upon their guard Dr. G. B. Thornton, President of the Memphis
Board of Health, has furnished under date of
July 1st the following full statement, respectin the occurrance of small-pox in that city from it first appearance on May 19th:

Matter The Record Made Three years ago the State Board of Healt determined to take charge of the State Weather
Service, then abandoned by the Bureau of
Agriculture, Statistics and Mines, and at th same time began the issue of the monthly
BuXLKTIN, which now enters upon its fourt volume The connection of climatology with diseas is rapidly becoming one of the three or fou advance movements which mark the presen time as an epoch in the history of medicine The Board, without dissent, judged that th meteorological records of Tennessee shoul be continued, preserved, and made known t the public at large The law enacted early in 1885. creating
County Boards of Health, gave the State
Board an official observer and reporter in eac of the ninety-six counties covering its area Were this law fully carried out a large amoun of valuable information respecting the preva-
lence of disease would be furnished in th monthly statements of the county health offi-
cers. Notwithstanding the meagre aid ex-
tended by the county courts to their healt officers, a large number of these have wit much public spirit entered zealously into th views of the State Board, and have fro month to month sent in valuable information The columns under the head, "Health in
Tennessee,' show in detail who have been th workers. It was hoped that long ere this ev-
ery town in Tennessee of two thousand inhab-
itants would have established a local board o health, through which exact mortality statis-
tics could be obtained. This hope has bee disappointed. Even large, thriving and grow-
ing communities, as Jackson, Union City,
Murfreesboro, Huntingdon, Brownsville, Day-
ton, South Pittsburg, Pulaski, Cleveland,
Athens, Bristol, not to name a number o others, exhibit an inexcusable lethargy on thi subject Throughout Europe and in most of th states comprising the American union, th most conclusive evidence received concernin salubrity is the death rate. Vague state-
ments concerning the general health go fo nothing; in fact, rather make against thos who give them out. The violent presump-
tion is that towns, cities and states which d not make and publish full records of ever fact connected with the movement of popu-
lation are afraid to do so. Tennessee ha lost, is now losing, and will continue to los by not maintaining a complete system of regis-
tration of marriages, births and deaths Thankful for the co-operation thus far re-
ceived, and sure of increased usefulnes ahead, the Bulletin enters upon its new vol-
ume by such increase of its pages as will ena-
ble it more fully than ever to fulfill its func-
tion of an official scientific record.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Yellow Fever Outlook Late in the autumn of 1886 an epidemic oc-
curred at Biloxi, Miss., which attracte great attention from the public at large as wel as from the medical profession. After n little racket it was finally decided with grea unanimity to be yellow fever This was a warning note, clearly sounded, t the people of Florida, Mississippi and Geor-
gia, reminding them significantly of the event studding the annals of 1873, 1878 and 1879 It is strange that thus warned the example o their neighbors in Louisiana, Alabama and
South Carolina was not followed and goo working state boards of health established,
with powers and means to keep wide awak and to assist and advise with local boards Many wise citizens of Florida did make a effort to awaken a lethargic legislature, but t no purpose At' Key West, Florida, on May 21, 1887,  case of yellow fever was reported, and up to
June 10, twenty-two cases and eight deaths The United States government, having grea interests there, used all means to stamp it out Yet, up to September 14, 282 cases and sixty-
two deaths were reported. A few cases onl afterwards; epidemic over At Tampa, on the Gulf coast of Florida, ou
October 7, twenty cases and four deaths fro yellow fever were reported and a panic in th city. To October 21 were reported 150 case and twenty-five deaths. To November 23, i all approximately, 380 cases and seventy-on deaths. Very little alter this, though ne cases were reported as late as the first week in
December. By December 23 the quarantin was raised and refugees allowed to return;  few scattering cases, mild in character, stil remaining Surely the people and public authorities of
Florida, a state of magnificent resources, rap-
idly growing in wealth and fame, ought t have waked up after these events The Florida Health Protective Associatio announces under the date of January 18,
1888, that no yellow fever exists in Florida a present An inspection at Micanopy, Plant City and
Bartow, in April, 1888, proved the recent ex-
istence of yellow fever there and that severa other points in the southern and western por-
tions of the state are to be looked upon as sus-
picious It was officially recognized that yellow feve had reappeared at Plant City on June 22, an at Tampa in July On July 19, the governor of Florida mad application to the secretary of the treasur for aid to the local health authorities in sup-
pressing the disease Above reports are taken from "Weekly
Abstract of Sanitary Reports," published b the United States Marine Hospital Service Siuce August 10 the telegraphic columns o the daily papers throughout the Union hav made Jacksonville famous for its yellow feve explosion, and now the whole world know how Florida with its long-extended ocean an gulf coasts has become permeated with th seeds of a pestilence which for virulence an panic heads the list We need not be surprised that thousand are flying from the Land of Flowers with it semi-tropical climate: and that great uneasi-
ness prevails in all the states adjoining or nea to Florida. In all that extensive region thi generation will not forget the records an scenes of 1878. A reproach it is upon our
Christian civililization that such uneasines should prevail. With state boards and loca boards as efficiently established as in Michi-
gan and Illinois, this and all epidemics woul be met with calm courage and humane care o all the afflicted As to what may happen this next fe months, prophecy is vain. So much depend upon weather, local cleanliness or dirt, an the careful watching of those coming from in-
fected districts Under favoring weather and filth this muc feared scourge has prevailed as far north a the New England states, and upon mountain of considerable elevation As to time we must remember that the epi-
demic of 1873, which cost Memphis 1,244 lives,
commenced September 14th and ended No-
vember 9th. The far famed one of 1878 be-
ginning probably July 11, reached to th close of November. These two great epidem-
ics reached far and wide and have made  mark in history, Although a decade ha elapsed, such has been the lethargy of peopl and officials as to make us fear lest the presen year should witness a repetition of panic ter-
rors and visionary precautions.

One simple but most efficacious sanitar measure is entirely neglected with rare excep-
tions throughout southland—namely, surfac scavengering. Streets, alleys, private premi-
ses should by the labor of men with carts b kept continually and perfectly clean from al garbage and other waste stuff. In this climat it is wonderful how much contamination w inhale from an atmosphere befouled by de-
caying animal and vegetable substances Rawlinson, the distinguished oriental traveler,
dwells upon the pollution of the surface soi as a principal cause of the exceedingly fata pestilences which so frequently devastate
Asiatic countries Privies, cess pools and other store houses o filth should by no means be stirred up at thi season. For these disinfectants should b freely used until next winter, when the should be thoroughly emptied and cleaned In the above two paragraphs a huge amoun of good sanitary work is mapped out for al parts of Tennessee, which should be done al the time, regardless of epidemic scares, an which repay many times the cost in diminish-
ing damage and death from ordinary and al-
ways prevalent disease. Every city and vil-
lage in the state should go to work now whil waked up by the sufferings of a sister state When once cleaned up the comfort and sens of decency and improved condition of healt thence resulting will be apt to continue th work Small-Fox During the years 1882-1883-1884 in differen portions of the state there were outbreaks o small-pox, costing the people large amount of money. At various times in 1885,1886 and
1887, the State Board of Health has pointedl called the attention of officials and the publi to make provision against the return of thi loathesome pestilence by the protection of in-
dividuals through vaccination, urging tha it is far better to use this precaution quietl and effectually when there is no panic alarm As usual, however, too little attention wa paid to this advice In various parts of the Union, far and wide,
during the present year, small-pox showin itself has given clear premonition of a grea outbreak next winter. Our own state ha been visited just enough to take timely warn-
ing On May 19th two different foci of this dis-
ease were discovered among the negro popula-
tion in Memphis, most probably introduce by river navigation from St. Louis. The cit health authorities at once took the necessar steps for stamping out the pest. To August
1st, total cases, 31; deaths, 4 In Obion county, some three miles north of
Union City, the disease was introduced by  negro from Memphis, from whom four whit persons contracted it. One death—the negro
—July 3d. No spread. The local authori-
ties carried out the regulations of this boar with admirable promptness On July 3d a real nest of this disease wa detected in a negro family near the souther limit of the city of Nashville. So far ther have been sixteen cases and one death. O the 5th the president of this board was re-
quested to attend a meeting of the city au-
thorities, when action was to be taken in th premises, and invited to address the council He said he had always been of the opinio that a small fire was easier to put out than  large one. He thought a liberal expenditur by the city at this time would save, perhaps,
ten times as great a one hereafter. He spok of the malignancy of the small-pox in man parts of the country and .the general appre-
hension among health officials throughout th continent of a worse epidemic than had bee experienced for many years The council promptly voted the sum of
$5,000.00 On this occasion it was ascertained tha several persons had gone on the mornin train of the 4th from Nashville to Christiana,
in Rutherford county. This fact was imme-
diately communicated to the health officer o that county, by whom the proper steps wer at once taken for care and isolation. Thre cases occurred, but no spread. The railroa coach was promptly disinfected On July 7th the president of the Nashville,
Chattanooga & St. Louis railroad was notifie by the mayor of Wartrace that quarantin would be established owing to many negr residents there working in Nashville. By di-
rection of the executive committee the secre-
tary visited Wartrace at once, got an exact

list of said laborers and communicated it t the proper officials, who thereupon stoppe them fronj visiting Wartrace This recent outbreak proves that promp precaution.s will prevent both spread of an scare from disease. It is indifference and care-
lessness at the start which permits an infect-
ious plague to get fairly under way, followe by panics such as are a blot upon our presen civilization Voice of Experience The following extract from a communica-
tion which we find in the New Orleans Times-
Democrat of the 15th inst., written by Dr Joseph Holt, recently president of the Louis-
iana State Board of Health, contains so muc good practical sense and at this time so per-
tinent, we give it place in this issue of the
Bulletin It is specifically addressed to the afflicte communities of Florida, but possesses a spe-
cial value to every locality where yellow feve may develop In the first place, to tell the whole truth
"even if the heavens fall," and to do i promptly; in the second place, to act in regar to suspicious cases as if real, using all pre-
cautionary measures to prevent others of mor positive kind; immediately to isolate the prem-
ises of the case in question, preventing abso-
lutely all coming and going, except as author-
ized; and prohibiting general attendance a such funerals. Prevent all noises and the cre-
ation of any fumes or odors that may affec prejudicially the patient. Earnestly advis to keep away all "distinguished physicians,"
both in behalf of the patient and the public,
and to call in some plain, common-sense doc-
tor or old woman, who has seen yellow feve and knows something about that most treach-
erous and peculiar of all diseases. Silentl and quietly mop the floors and treat ever available surface in the house, furniture in-
cluded, with the solution of the bichloride o mercury, one part to about one-thousandth o water This solution is prepared by taking si ounces each of the bichloride of mercury an muriate of ammonia, rubbing together well i a mortar, dissolving in a gallon of hot wate and adding to forty gallons of water. Let th mopping of floors include the siek room Have just outside this door a wooden tub con-
taining a few gallons of the solution, colore by the addition of a little blueing (to preven any possible error in mistaking it for drinkin water, for there is no danger in the solutio except if swallowed), and see to it that ever article of clothing or bedding taken from thi room is at once saturated with the solution i this tub. Wet the surface of every hall,
stairway and room, including carpets, mat and furniture, with the solution, using mop and fine spray watering pots. Wet in lik manner the surface of the surrounding yard,
sidewalk and the street It. is well to treat neighboring premises, a least to the extent of wetting floors and yards In the event of an epidemic prevailing, thi treatment should include every house in town In the case of a death, immediately wrap th corpse in a sheet saturated with the mercuri solution of a strength 1 to 300 When the disease manifests a disposition t spread, let every man, woman and child in th entire town put on clothing that has bee dipped in the milder solution as first describe and then dried. If the colors should run o the clothing be a little stained, as may possi-
occur, what does that signify in such a terri-
ble emergency?
Urge the people of Jacksonville and of al invaded places to use the bichloride solutio as lavishly as rainwater in regard to its gen-
eral and thorough distribution. Let them or-
der it by the 500 or 1.000 pounds. There i positively no danger from the solution, excep when swallowed. As soon as it can be don without injury to the sick, let every room b treated with the sulphur fumigation When the sulphurous fumigation is use after the wetting of surfaces with the mercu-
ric solution, "the sulphurous gas" does not
"unite with the murcuric salt, forming a com-
pound which impairs the germidical powers o both," as declared by Assistant Surgeon J. J Kinyoun, of the United States Marine Hospi-
tal Service, in his recent report on the Louis-
iana Quarantine That officer was sent here as an expert, an has made a positive statement in regard to  point in chemistry without having taken th trouble to try the experiment When sulphurous acid gas, or liquid, o sulphuric acid is added to a solution of th bichloride of mercury there is absolutely n chemical interchange, but the solution re-
mains perfectly clear. A drop or two of th solution of the iodide of potash will revea the mercuric element by an abundant precip-
itation.
I correct this error because of its practica importance All the methods of the Lousiana Board of
Health in such a case of that of Jacksonvill are commendable because they are easily un-
derstood, are simple of application, are thor-
oughly indorsed by science and experience,
are gentle, humane and economical, and fi-
nally, offer the only substantial hope there i in such a case.

The above table is extracted from Dr. Ed-
ward Smith's highly scientific work on
"Foods/' as it seems to have been made ou with much care. It should be stated, how-
ever, that other analysts have given result considerably at variance with these,* espe-
cially as regards the percentage of protoplasti substances, such as glutine, albumen, cereal-
ine,etc., all which are included in the secon column. This is not surprising when it i noticed that different samples of wheat hav given results so widely apart that one speci-
men has given over double the percentage o another, placing the former as a maximu and the latter very nearly as a minimum—
though the latter must have been derive from a very inferior grade of wheat As these papers are prepared for practica rather than for scientific readers, we wil meDtion a test which good housewives some-
times apply in selecting flour, namely, by tak-
ing a little in the hand and squeezing it forci-
bly, when good flour, will retain the shape s given on opening the hand, but inferior flou immediately falls to powder again ; this cohe-
siveness depends upon the quantity of glutin in the specimen Now, in comparing the bread stuffs, glutin and the other nitrogenous principles will ap-
pear the most important of their constituent we shall have to treat of. It is true that, a we stated in our last paper, the amount o these principles in the bread stuffs is not s great as to make them important factors in th formation of tissue, especially when accom-
*M. Payen (Preow d> Ckimir, IndiutrieBe), gives the re-
sult ot five analyses of wheat samples, in which th percentage of starch and nitrogenized matter is state as follows:
Starch. Nitrogen Hard Wheat of Venezuela 58.12 22.74
"Africa 64 57 19.50
"Taganrog, Russia 6i.S0 20 00
Medium Hard of Brie. France 63.65 16.25
White Tuzelle of France 75.31 11.20
The last of these specimens can hardly have bee sound wheat. Generally, hard and Bonthern grow wheats contain more nitrogenzed matter than soft an northern.
paued by animal food, but they have a mos important office to perform in promoting th efficiency of the starch itself; for it is in virtu of the fermentation that it undergoes withi the body that starch can be serviceable in an of the ways described in our last paper, an that fermentation can not be brought abou without the presence of some nitrogenous sub-
stance which is itself decomposed in excitin the process. Hence a few words may be her presented by way of somewhat enlargin the popular conception of the purposes sub-
served by fermentation in the body As generally understood, fermentation ma be described as a decomposition of organi matter attended by heat; the decompose matter being generally a carbohydrate and th decomposition being excited by the presenc of another organic substance containing nitro-
gen. But (and this is the point to which at-
tention is now specially called) fermentatio is accoinpained by another phenomenon, th development of new and living organic beings:
thus in that form of the process by whic starch or sugar is transformed into alcohol,  microscopic cryptogram, the torvla cerevisii,
or yeast plant, is produced; again, when th grain of barley is fermented so as to produc malt, the organic product is simply the newl vegetating barley itself, a vegetation which i cut short and its forces stored up as it were i the process of drying These processes are among the most interest-
ing in chemistry and physiology, but we mus resist the temptation to dwell upon them, th leading principle insisted upon being that, i the process of fermentation, organic substanc is destroyed as an essential prerequisite fo producing new organisms. To produce th starch, when it was first originated, from car-
bonic acid and water, force was involve usually in the form of heat and light; when,
on the other hand, that combination is dis-
solved, or in chemical language decompose and seperated into its original constitutents o carbonic acid and water, the original forces

are liberated or evolved and again make thei appearance in the form of heat, but not o heat alone. They are partly made availabl for the production of new organisms Outside of the body these appear in suc forms as have already been alluded to as th yeast plant or the newly germinating barley—
but wnen consumed as food, these are not th products. Then the normal processes of the
Dody, those of virilization, assimilation, secre-
tion, etc., etc., in short, the functions of ani-
mal life are excited by the same forces as out-
side of the body would simply produce th torula cerevisii. Hence, to express the foo problem as compendiously as possible, the pro-
toplasmic elements furnish the material, th carbohydrates, the forces which organize it Of course, from- this principle it follow that the less fermentation has taken place i the food before it is eaten, the more is left t occur after eating, and the more force become available for the stimulation of the vital pro-
cesses Now, here, I am going to be met with an ob-
jection. There are diseases of digestion—
these accompanied with belching, sour stomach,
etc.,—which are attributed to food fermentin internally, and it is inferred that food ough not to ferment after being swallowed. Th answer to this is, that the products of fermen-
tation are in such case the same as thos which result outside of the body; these vita principles which ought to be stimulated by i fail to act in consequence of some depresse condition in the general system, some low con-
dition of vitality dependent upon the impaire nervous action; the condition of the body ap-
proximates that of a corpse,and the fermenta-
tion acts as if in a dead rather than a livin body. We are concerned not with such case but with alimentation during health. There i no food which does not ferment; so that to at-
tempt withholding materials of fermentatio would be to withhold food altogether. It i not excessive fermentation that is in faul there, but simply that fermentation fails t produee such effects as arc proper to livin bodies It is mainly, then, through their power o exciting and maintaining fermentation, tha the bread stuffs are efficient in the body a articles of food, and the carbohydrates furnis the materials for that process and the proto-
plasmic principels supply the forces which se it in action ; the most energetic of these seem to be the cerealine.
I know of no analysis which determines th presence of this important principle in othe grains besides wheat, nor in that quantitatively So that we can only compare the relativ value of grains as producers of protoplasmi principles by observing their relative quantit of nitrogenous material Moreover, as the chemical constitution o starch and wood fibre is identical, and as th latter is not mentioned in any of the analyses
I have consulted, I infer that it is included i the starch estimate, which is unfortunate a.<
wood fibre or lignine is (at least under ordi-
nary methods of preparation) entirely innu-
tritious. We have to assume, therefore, tha its prevalence in the different grains is nearl the same, and to infer that the third colum of our table represents the presence of carbo-
hydrate nutriments relatively if not abso-
lutely. We may safely assume then that th comparative quantity of starch and nitrogen-
ous principles give us a fair estimate of the nu-
tritive value of grain, the latter representin its capacity for supporting bodily strength Maize or Indian Corn—For its abundan production and its very general use in thi country, demands ourattention next to wheat In comparing its chemical constitution wit that of wheat, as represented on our table, w find the only important difference to appear i the item of fat or oleaginous matter, of whic it contains eight times as much as wheat; th table, however, takes no account of the indi-
gestible woody fibre which in both estimates i included in the starch, and which both dimin-
ishes its nutritive value and acts as an irritan on the intestinal canal. The influence of thi however is much diminished by the carefu sifting to which every skillful housekeepe subjects her corn-meal before she makes i into bread Owing probaly to this characteristic, corn-
bread requires more thorough cooking tha that made of wheat, and this again necessitate its being baked, not in loaves but in thi cakes, and the thinner the better; the hoe-
cake of the negro cabin is the model for corn-
bread when made of corn-meal alone. Bu the most palatable and, as we believe, th most digestible preparation, is made by th admixture of some wheat-flour and eggs, con-
stituting the egg bread of the Southern table The larger predominance of oil renders maiz more heating than wheat-flour, as is wel known where it is used for horse feed, thi quality making it important to use larger pro-
portions of long feed, such as hay and fodder,
than is necessary further North, where oat take the place of maize in the stables. Fo this reason there is little doubt that the uni-
versal consumption of corn-bread and baco as country fare throughout the South contrib-
utes fully as much as climatic peculiarities t the prevalence of bilious fevers in those lati-
tudes Oats.—The value of oats as food for men in
England has been well known since the day of Dr. Samuel Johnson, from its having give occasion for a signal defeat of the great lexi-
cographer in conversational repartee. Indee the Doctor's defeat has been prolonged dow to the present day by the very general adoptio of oat-meal wherever the English language i spoken, as a specially healthy source of nutri-
ment for man as well as beast. The breakfas of oat meal and boiled milk is an instituto now very widely sanctioned both on sanitar and gastronomic principles over a very wide

extent of the earth's surface—and deservedl so.
A reference to our table will show that th chief characteristic of oats as compared wit wheat and maize consists in the larger propor-
tion of nitrogenous or protoplasmic elements,
indicating a greater power of supplying plasti materials apart from animal food; in this re-
spect oats surpass all other cereals. In regar to the carbohydrates, there is less starch tha in the other two, but the defect is partly mad up by a greater percentage of sugar in whic as well as in protoplasmic principles it sur-
passes all other cereals; and this feature prob-
ably accounts partly for its acting so kindly o the digestive organs of children which un-
doutedly demand more sugar than those o adults Oats resemble maize in ^regard to bot containing more woody fibre than other ce-
reals, which can only be made digestible by th application of greater heat in cooking. Henc the oat-cake of the Scotch, like the hoe-cak of the Southern negro, is thin, giving thereb greater access of heat to its interior, and thi suggests an important hint to the Souther housekeeper who, when she makes a mess o oat-meal porridge for breakfast, does not boil i nearly as long as her Scottish sister; it ough to be%reduced nearly to a jelly before served Barley—Need not be here considered a an an article of food, since neither in thi country nor in Europe is it cultivated for tha purpose; its only destination in either hemis-
phere is to be consigned to the brewers in th form of malt as a step to the production o beer, porter, ale, whiskey and the other mem-
bers of Sir John Barleycorn's family Rye—Has been disregarded also in view o its very rare use as human food in this country Rice and Potatoks—Are there also.thoug the latter is not a cereal, for the purpose o showing their great defect in all nutritive ele-
ments except starch—a characteristic suffi-
cient in itself to account for the national de-
generation, resulting wherever they are use as the exclusive nutriment of the people, th potato for instance in Ireland, the rice in
Hindostan.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Health Officer, Pomona.—Diarrho?a, cholera in-
fantum and malaria cover the lint of diseases i this county for the month of July Davidson courtly—-Dr. W. C. Cook, County
Health Officer, Nashville.—The general health o the county has been quite good; an occasiona case of scarlet fever being reported. During th latter part of June an outbreak of small pox oc-
curred in the city of Nashville, which, however,
waS not reported to the city health departmen till July 3. There were two centres of infection i opposite suburbs of the city and great apprehensio was felt for a time that the disease might becom widespread. As soon as the disease was reporte to the county health officer, the county board wa convened and we immediately took steps to sen all exposed and afflicted persons to the small-po hospital. In a single day and half a night w purchased all household and kitchen furniture,
secured a resident physician, hired a matron, coo snd all needed servants—had every arrange-
ment made to fully equip the hospital and ha all the patients and suspects to the number o sixteen safely removed and lodged therein a comfortably as their misfortune would allow We received into the institution during July, 27
persons, all colored. Of these there were adults,
13; minors, 14; males, 16; females, 11. Cases o small-pox, 16; suspects, 11. Died, 1 ; discharged,
10; on hand August 1, 16. The authority grant-
ed the county boards of health, under act of 1885,
enabled us to at once proceed to grapple with thi loathsome and insidious pest with a promptnes and effectiveness unparalled in the history of th disease in this state, and demonstrated the grea wisdom displayed in the passage of the law. Th indications are that the contagion has now bee confined within the hospital and that we may con-
sider the community freed from its ravages unles imported from other points Nashville— Dr. Chas. Mitchell,City Health Officer.
—The prevailing diseases during the month wer diarrheal diseases, malarial and typho-inalaria fevers. The mortality of the month is highe than that of the preceding month, but compare favorably with the corresponding month of pre-
vious years. July has always been one of ou worst months. On the 3d of July I received a anonymous communication stating that there wa some suspicious sickness on Cannon street, in
South Nashville. I visited the locality and foun four cases of small-pox and varioloid in thre colored families. The houses were quarantined,
and the county health authorities, who under th state laws are the custodians of the county pest-
house and its appurtenances for the removal an treatment of small-pox patients, were immediatel notified and requested to send the ambulance fo the sick as soon as possible. All of the availabl virus in the city was purchased and the inmate of the quarantines and residents of the immediat vicinity were vaccinated. On the morning of the
4th I discovered another c»*e in a colored famil on Patterson street, in the western suburbs of th city. This house was also quarantined, but n virus could be procured to vaccinate the inmates The disease in each instance was easily traced t the steamboat traffic with St. Louis. Both of th bove localities are densely populated negro set-
ments and we were without any appropriatio or other adequate facilities for the suppression o the disease. The mayor, therefore, at the reques of the board of health, convened the city counci in extraordinary session and asked for an appro-
priation to meet the emergency. The city coun-
cil thereupon made an appropriation of $5,000.00,
to be expended in such manner as the board o health might direct, for stamping out the dis-
ease. Virus was ordered by telegraph from tw reliable producing establishments, and twenty-
four physicians were employed and at once put t work in the alleys and tenement houses huntin out and vaccinating the unprotected. S[>ecial an almost exclusive attention was given to the col-
ored race and the poorer class of whites, as th records of this department for previous year show that these classes of our population furnishe more than ninety-five per cent of all the case registered. On the morning of the 4th, Judie
Phillips, who had the disease in the confluen form, died; this left one of the houses free of th disease, but the quarantine was continued ove the remaining inmates as suspects. On the night of the 5th and 6th the pest-house ambulanc transferred the sick and suspects from th three houses to the hospital. During the nex two weeks six other cases were developed in per-
sons who had been exposed to the original cases,
all of whom were promptly removed to the hos-
pital. Having passed through the period of in-
cubation without the development of any mor cases, we can safely assert that this invasian ha been entirely stamped out Decatur county—Dr. J. F. Aydelott, County
Health Officer, Decaturville.—No report received DcKoJb county—Dr. M. L. Wilson, County
Health Officer, Smithville.—No report received Dickson county.—No board organized Dyer county—Dr. J. P. C. Walker, County
Health Officer, Dyeraburg.—The health of thi county for July would compare favorably wit the corresponding month of 1887. The differen forms of malaria constituted the prevailin trouble, next in order the diarrhajas, also som ileo-colitis, usually complicated with bronchitis Dysentery is said to have prevailed in the neigh-
borhood of Newbern Dyersburg—Dr. H. F. Ferguson, President;
Dr. F. Summers, Secretary, City Board of Health.
—No report received Fayetle county—Dr. W. A. Ealy, County Health
Officer, Somerville.—We had a good deal of sick-
nessduring the month of July; bilious and malaria fevers, flux and bowel affections among childre were the most prevalent diseases that we had t contend with Fentress county—Dr. J. Bertram, County Health
Officer, Little Crab.—No report received Frank!in county—Dr. J.C. Shapard, County Health
Officer, Winchester.—There was not much sick-
ness in this county during the month of July, an the cases that di'l occur were mostly mild; a least not of a serious grade. Fevers of a some-
what doubtful type, a remission if not an inter-
mission of mornings, with an evening tempera-
ture of only 101 or 102, a slight diarrhoja or ten-
dency thereto and persisting in spite of treatmen three or four weeks. Scarlet fever prevailed i some parts of the county, which was called ros-
ola by the people and by some of the p vsiciau.

During the month there were a few cases of dys-
entery, more of diarrhoea, and cholera infantu was quite frequent. Whooping cough was occa-
sionally seen Gibson county—Dr. T. J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—For July in Trenton and im-
mediate vicinity health has been good. A fe cases of continued remittent fever of a vtry ob-
stinate character have been met with in the cit limits. Some of them were called typhoid fever,
but the history of the cases showed their malaria origin. Dysentery of a mild type has at time threatened to become troublesome. Children s far are having but little trouble with the summe diseases. There are about eight or ten cases o pertussis in the city. From District 5, Brazil, Dr
Clendennin reports little sickness; a few cases o diarrhoea and bilious fever. One death; age, 93
years. Dr. Davidson, of Dyer, District 21, report health as usual for this season. Dr. A. W Stephenson, of the same place, reports an exces of sickness of rather an asthenic type, with on case of phlegmonous erysipelas—fatal. He als reports a curious freak of nature—a child bor without eyes or nose and having the brain cover-
ed only by its membraues "in the crown of th head." He also reports dysentery of a mild typ which yielded to treatment easily. Dr. Moore, of
Bradford, District 14, reports "only a moderat amount of sickness" during July, consisting o bowel diseases of children, malarial fever unci  few cases of flux, with one death. He reports i difficult to interest the people in the subject o vaccination. Dr. Altman, of District 12, report an increase of sickness in his practice. His pre-
vailing diseases were intermittent and remitten fevers, diarrhoea and dysentery, with one case o typhoid fever. He adds that children have suf-
fered more than usual from bowel diseases. An another fact which I have found to be true, viz:
that malarial fevers yield more slowly than usua to quinine. Dr. Clay, of Rutherford, reports in-
termittent and remittent fevers with dysentery, a prevailing diseases, with one death from pneumo-
nia in a child of fifteen months Milan—M. D. L. Jordan, M. D.—Diarrhoea i adults and children has prevailed to some extent,
but not as much as usual for June. Except a above health is good Trenlon—A. S. Currey, Esq.—Health continue good ax usual at this season. As an indication o prevailing sickness in his practice, Dr. J. T Shackleford reports that, of the eighteen cases o dysentery reported last month, one died on the
4th of July. The patient was 78 years old an worn down with chronic disease of the lungs; al the others recovered. One fatal case of diarrhoe occurred in a patient 88 years old. Twelve cases o remittent fever, not yielding readily to quinine One case congestion of the lungs, yielding to hypo-
dermic injections of morphine and atropia. Eigh cases of dysentery .'seven children and one adult) Several cases of cholera morbus; two of summe complaint. Malarial fevers occurring in severa localities, but not more than usual at this season Giles county—Dr. C. A. Abernathy, County
Health Officer, Pulaski —No report received Grainger county—-Dr. J. H. Campbell, County
Health Officer, Kutledge.—No report received Greene county—Dr. E. B. Smith, County Health
Officer, Greeneville.—No report received Grundy county—Dr. L. P. Barber, Tracy City.—
We have had less sickness than usual in Grund county for the time of the year during the mont of July. Stomach and bowel troubles have bee the most prevalent diseases. The two deaths tha have occurred in this part of the county have bee from summer complaint of children; one cas complicated with whooping cough. A few case of tonsilitis have been noticed. Whooping coug is the only contagious disease Hamblen county—Dr. D. E. Shields, County
Health Officer, Morristown.—No report received Hamilton county—Dr. E. M. Eaton, County
Health Officer, Chattanooga.—-Thehealth of Ham-
ilton county has been remarkably good. The pre-
vailing sickness has been dian-hoeal diseases Hancock county—Dr. Jesse B. Mitchell, County
Health Officer, Datura.—Nothing unusual to re-
port. We yet have in some portions of the count an occasional case of malarial fever. Scattere over the county are some cases of dysentery, wit now and then cholera morbus and the "summe complaint" among children. These compose th sicknees of Hancock county Hardeman county—Dr. Jas. J. Neely, Jr., County
Health Officer, Bolivar.—No report received Hardin county—Dr. J. K. Barlow, County
Health Officer, Savannah.—No report received
Hawkins county—Dr. R. P. Mitchell, County
Health Officer, Rogersville.—We still had dys-
entery raging among us during the last month,
but assumed a milder type. Bu( still there ha been several deaths among infants. Typhoid fe-
ver has prevailed to some extent; a majority o cases yielded to treatment. There have been sev-
eral cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis; one death,
which occurred 9 hours after patient was stricken Cholera infantum and diarrhoea prevail amon children. One death of hemorrhage of the bowels There has been less sickness during the last tw weeks in our commuuity than for several months Obstetrical cases have been on the increase. On case of twins in our village.
I see in the papers and the Bulletin tha variola prevails in several localities in thi state, and that the State Board of Healt calls on the various counties to protect them-
selves from the spread of this disease. There i no county in Tennessee where vaccination ha been so universal as in Hawkins. Our count made liberal appropriation four years ago to ar-
rest this disease. More than $4,000.00 was spen to arrest its ravages. We had about forty case in Big Poor Valley. I was appointed by the cen-
tral committee to take charge of them and es-
tablish a quarantine. I had no idea of the pov-
erty and degradation in our midst. All our sup-
plies, even soap, towels and change of bed clothe and wearing apparel were received from town The disease was of the confluent type. There wa one hovel in which there were eight cases. I same there were two confinements; the mother and infants died in less than twenty-four hour after birth. I will write more about it in future Haywood county—Dr. J. H Howell, County
Health Officer, Brownsville.—No report received Henderson county.—No board organized Henry county—Dr.S. C. Edmunds, County Health
Officer, Paris.—In July there were about thirty-

two deaths in this county from all causes. Twelv miles north of Paris in the neighborhood of Cheap
Valley, acute dysentery prevailed to a considera-
ble extent, many deaths therefrom and a fe cases still on hand. About ten cases of typhoi fever with two deaths have occurred throughou the county. The various forms of malarial fevers,
diarrhoea, cholera morbus and infantile diarrhoe have existed to a moderate extent. The town of
Paris has been exempt almost from any diseases Hickman county—No board organized Houston county—Dr. T. W. Nichols, County

tions of this county. Some few deaths; als cholera morbus and cholera infantum, with a fe cases of gastro-enteritis. Few cases of rubeola Jefferson county—Dr. Jaa. A. Harris, County
Health Officer, Dandridge.—No report received Johnson county—Dr. J. W. Donnelly, County
Health Officer, Mountain City.—There has no been any report from our county for some time But it is not from a lack of interest in the work o the board of health. There have been a grea many epidemic diseases in our county within th last twelve months, to-wit: measles, roseola, scar-
latina, mumps, typhoid fever, tonsilitis, choler morbus, cholera infantum, diarrhoea and dysen-
tery. There is and has been a great deal of dys-
entery, some severe cases, but none fatal. But o the whole I think our county is in a very health condition. Our geographical situation and nat-
ural drainage, together with our pure water an invigorating atmosphere, makes our county ver healthy. Most all the epidemic diseases are of  very mild type. I will be more prompt in report-
ing hereafter Knox county.—Dr. W. M. Rutherford, County
Health Officer, Beverly.—Sickness in this sectio somewhat on the increase. Typhoid and typho-
malarial fevers mostly prevail; from the forme two or three deaths have been reported. A fe cases of dysentery, diarrhoea and a case or two o pneumonia make up the sum total of our afflic-
tions for July Knorville—Dr. S. B. Boyd, City Health Officer —
During the month eleven cases of scarlet feve were reported, and three cases of diphtheria, wit one death. There were quite a number of case of typhoid fever during the month, especially i the suburbs of the city Lake county.—Dr. M. Donaldson, County Health

Monroe street. From the 7th of July to the 30t no new cases were in the infected location, 265
Monroe street; in fact, no cases were found in th city during that time except the three landed b boats and the one found at 213$ Court street The three cases found July SOth were little child-
ren who had lived there a long time, and the Ins time it was possible for them.to come in contac with small-pox was July 7th, to the best of m knowledge. Again, on June 2d, Dr. Black re-
ported a case ol small-pox at the city hospital,
also one June 18th and one June 19th. The tw latter were in the hospital when the first cas broke out; in fact, they had both been there som weeks before with chronic troubles and never lef until they were carried away Buffering with small-
pox. From the above the question arises in m mind—is it safe to allow persons held in quaran-
tine because exposed to small-pox, to go free afte ten days have elapsed? There was no way fo the two cases at the city hospital to be expose but the once, and it was sixteen days before th first and seventeen days before the second on took the disease. The last three cases went twen-
ty-three days Smith county—Dr. Frank Swope, County Health

formed that some refugees got off the trai north of Birmingham, believed to have th fever."

out letting us see them if they can, but I wil try my best to be on the lookout."

stopping all passenger trains between Way-
cross, Ga., and Florida points, goes into effec to day. The people here clamor for a rigi quarantine, and I am giving it to thein; m inspectors are all good officers and obey all in-

field, from Orlando, Fla., destination Louis-

picious to-day."
IN ATLANTA Inspector Lynch, of Chattanooga, reports,
under date of August 27:
"No passengers from Florida have passe through the city to-day. I was informed thi afternoon that several parties from Jackson-
ville would board the train to-morrow at Dal-
ton to come to Chattanooga. I immediatel gave the facts to my inspectors and instructe them to look out for these parties and inter-
cept them. Hearing yesterday afternoon tha three cases of yellow fever had broken out in
Atlanta, I immediately wrote to^he Secretar of the Atlanta Board of Health, and here-
with inclose a copy of his reply. From what
I can gather, the doors of Atlanta and Dalto are not as wide open to Florida refugees a they are supposed to be. Inspector Brow came down from Cleveland this morning t see me for conference. He is doing all th inspecting himself, and it will be impossibl for him to inspect the train from Clevelan to Chattanooga, consequently I will apply to-
morrow for an additional man for that line."
The report from Atlanta referred to is a follows:
"There has not been a single case of yello fever in Atlanta this year. If a case shoul be brought here or should occur here, it wil be officially announced through the press im-
mediately. In view of late publications in
Chattanooga papers, would it not be well t give this assurance publicity. A rigid inspec-
tion of trains is maintained, and we will in-
form you by wire of any suspicious cases The woman, Mrs. Miller, of whom I wire you a few days ago, stopped finally at Calhoun Her symptoms, I am informed, have all sub-
sided Yours truly,
Jas. B. Baird, Secretary."

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
"Yours of the 30th inst. received thi morning. I instructed my inspectors som time ago to pay particular attention to pas-
sengers from Atlanta, Daltonand Decatur, for
I recognized the fact that it was an easy mat-
ter for refugees to stop over in either of thes places long enough to buy a ticket and rechec their baggage. I do not think that many ref-
ugees coming from those points have elude the vigilance of the officers, for as a rule thei baggage has some mark upon it that betray them. As most of the refugees who com this way come via the Western & Atlanti railroad and the East Tennessee, Virginia &
Georgia railrqad (Georgia division), a deten-
tion station has been established at Boyce an one at Sherman Heights. The stations ar not over a mile apart, and an officer is sta-
tioned at each place to see that the refugee who are put off there do not come into thi city. Most of the refugees board the Cincin-
nati train at Boyce and go north, or they tak the next train to Atlanta. I inspect fourtee trains per day, the first at 4:37 a.m., the las one at 11:40 p.m. Inspectors on the Western
& Atlantic, and on the East Tennessee, Vir-
ginia & Georgia railroads board the trains at
Dalton. The Alabama Great Southern rail-
road is boarded at Rising Fawn; the Memphis
& Charleston railroad is boarded at Stevenson;
the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia rail-
road, main line, is boarded at Cleveland; the
C, R. & C. railroad is boarded justout-side th city limits. The latter is a new road an runs only one regular train a day; the trave is mostly local.
I have the following refugee cases to report:
"F. E. Noble, male, aged 33. Left Jack-
sonville yesterday and boarded Cincinnati
Southern train at Boyce to-day for Cincinnati His baggage had not been disinfected. W. S Robinson, male, aged 25. Left Jacksonvill yesterday and went through to Pittsburg to-
day. He had no baggage. The inspector wh came in on the 55, left Jacksonville, Fla.,
August 11, and is going through to Cincinnati His baggage had not been disinfected. B. R Newcomb accompanied the above name party. He left Jacksonville on the same day,
and is going to Cincinnati. His baggage ha not been disinfected. I would not jet the stop here, but transferred them without dela to the Cincinnati train and stationed an office near to see they did not leave the coach."
The following report is from Dr. James E Reeves, who was appointed by the State Boar of Health to go South and there personall inspect the different quarantines at this tim in force, both State and National, with th view of determining what protection, if any,
Tennessee derives from such quarantines:
Waycros8, Ga., Aug. 31,1888.
J. D. Plunket, M. D., President State Boar of Health, Nashville, Tenn.:
Sir—For several hours I have been in con-
sultation with Surg. Maj. Wm. H. Hutton,
the representative of the Marine Hospital
Service, who has charge of the quarantine ser-
vice at this station, and learned from him th following facts: Outside of Jacksonville,
where the epidemic is increasing day by day,
(and will continue to increase, probably, fo the next twenty days), the disease is also
Sresent at Plant City. Manatee, and Pabl leach, with one death reported at Sweet
Water. There has been no outbreak of th disease North and West of the line of the
Florida Railway and Navigation Company, o the line from Cedar Keys via Gainesville and
Callahan to Fernandina. The late order is-
sued from the office of the Supervising Sur-
geon General of the Marine Hospital Service,
if faithfully observed and enforced, will com-
pletely bottle up Jacksonville, and thus lesse the danger from a spread of the disease. Th following is a copy of the order above al-
luded to:
CIRCULAR Regulations for the prevention of the sprea of yellow fever from certain infected places i the State of Florida:
Treasury Department,
Office Supervising Surgeon-
General, United States
Marine Hospital Sevice,
Washington, D. C, Aug. 28,1888 In accordance with the act of April 29.
1878. and appropriation acts authorizing th maintenance of quarantine at points of danger,
the following regulations are framed to assis in the work of preventing the spread of yello fever, now prevailing as an epidemic in cer-
tain towns in the State of Florida.
1. A camp of refuge for persons from in-
fected places in Florida is hereby established,
to be under command of Passed Assistant
Surgeon Guiteras, on the south bank of the
St. Mary's river, near the crossing of the Sa-
vannah, Florida & Western railroad, to b known as Camp Perry. Temporary quarantin stations are hereby established under directio of Surgeon Hutton, Marine Hospital Service,
near Waycross, Ga., and Live Oak, Fla.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLE11N.

Those at DuPont, Ga., and Chattahoochee
River Junction are hereby discontinued.
2. At the stations aforesaid, an inspectio will be made of all persons, baggage, mail, an express arriving by rail from points South;
and in case of arrival of any person, mail, bag-
gage, or express matter capable of conveyin infection, coming from an infected place o place not known to be healthy, ps shown b recent inspection reports, then such perso shall either be returned to the original plac of embarkation or to Camp Perry, at his o her option, and the baggage of such perso shall be held for fumigation, and fumigate under the direction of the officer in charge Mail matter from infected places will be fu-
migated under the direction of the Railway
Mail Service under orders already issued b that service.
3. xVll persons arriving in Camp Perry wil be under the orders of the commanding officer,
and will not depart the camp without permis-
sion until ten days shall have elapsed from th date of their departure from an infected place.
A special daily train will run between Jack-
sonville and Camp Perry, for the purpose o conveying persons from Jacksonville and suc other business as may be incident thereto, an at the expiration of the detention period suc persons will be taken to Waycross, and the allowed to proceed to their destination with-
out further detention.
4. Railway agents, conductors or persons i charge of railway trains south of and in-
cluding those of the Savannah, Florida &
Western Railroad will not receive person from infected places on board trains, excep to the refuge camp, as provided in paragrap one of this circular, and sleeping cars will no be allowed to proceed south of Waycross, 6a.,
until the cessation of the epidemic.
5. An additional refuge camp, under th same regulations as those governing Camp
Perry, will be established in the mountains of
North Carolina (the site hereafter to be deter-
mined) as soon as practicable Joun B. Hamilton,
Supervising Surgeon General Approved:
C. S. Fairchild,
Secretary of the Treasury It is really assuring to witness the seemin unconcern of the people of Waycross, onl seventy-six miles distant from the scourge city of Jacksonville, on the subject of yello fever; yet this has been the gateway throug which thousands of refugees have fled fo places of safety in the upper country of Geor-
gia, Alabama and Tennessee My confidence in the effectiveness of th quarantine and the public safety afforde thereby, has been greatly strengthened by m investigations of the system here enforced Maj. Hutton seems to be the right man in th right place, and will suffer no violation of hi orders. To-day the disinfecting station, tw miles below here, has been shut up for th reason that neither a passenger nor piece o baggage was brought through from Jackson-
ville. I have been assured that Camp St Mary's, thirty miles from Jacksonville, is be-
coming an acceptable resort, and that alread over 200 tents have been spread and occupied,
with room for hundreds more. The locatio is high and dry, in a word, the site is mos admirably suited to the emergency. Th truth is now plainly seen that the only suc-
cessful method of combatting the spread o yellow fever, or stamping out infected centers,
is to break up the population of scourge cities or towns to the greatest possible exten by offering temporaay homes on healthy an inviting camp-grounds to all classes of citizens,
and to throw around all a cordon of quaran-
tine so close that no one can overstep its line If the stringent means and the relief whic are now enforced and supplied had been in-
augurated two or three weeks ago, there woul have been fewer cases in Jacksonville, an less fear in the public mind of the genera spread of the disease. My observation, whil on this journey of inspection service, has full satisfied me of the worse than folly of ap-
pointing unskilled persons—common police-
men—as quarantine inspectors. It is simpl dangerous waste of official confidence. T emphasize this truth, I could give some ludi-
crous examples, if trifling with a serious sub-
ject were a becoming part of my duty The present lamentable experience in Flor-
ida—the feeling of her citizens, the derange-
ment of her business, not to mention the sick-
ness and deaths among the multitude at hom in the stricken city—will not soon be forgot-
ten; and if the costly experience in the los both of life and property shall secure better

methods of protection for the future, then th sacrifice will not have been entirely withou benefit. The culpability of the State authori-
ties of Florida will no doubt be a subject fo discussion by the next Legislature; for it i safe to say, if the State Board of Health ha been given the means it asked for, the diseas would have been stamped out with the firs case in Jacksonville The United States Government, also, is no less to be blamed. She has undisputed con-
trol of coast quarantine, yet, every year, case of yellow fever are brought from Havana an other places in Cuba. Besides why, with th thousands times told danger of yellow fever i the Southern ports, was there not preparatio made for the coining of the unwelcome guest?
Why not already on hand cars specially con-
structed for the work of quick and thoroug disinfection of mails, baggage, etc.?
All these and many other just counts of in-
dictment I could make against the authoritie in the case Finally I think you may assure the peopl of Tennessee that they will escape the infec-
tion. With the new and better order o things at Wayeross for the public safety, wil there be also greater security to the State of
Tennessee. I go next to Macon; thence to
Columbus to see that these two importan points are properly guarded against all per-
sons from infected districts in Florida Your obedient servant,
James E. Reeves.

AT PULASKI Inspector Abernathy reports under date of
September 1:
"I have commenced a daily run down to
Decatur, in order that I may be able to in-.
spect the trains and to prevent passenger from Florida checking their baggage to tha place and rcchecking to other points. I fin that the quarantine officers there are ver vigilant and strict, and do not let persons wh have been in Florida, even in portions of the
State not infected with yellow fever, stop in
Decatur. As an evidence of their rigid quar-
antine, a Mr. Stewart, commercial tourist from
Louisville, Ky., who had been on a busines trip to Pensacola for half a day, was denied th privilege of stopping off for dinner on yester-
day. So it is hardly possible for fugitives t check baggage to Decatur and recheck with-
out detection—in fact the quarantine on the
Louisville & Nashville Railroad below is s strict it will be almost impossible for fugitive to escape inspection. When they understan the nature of the quarantine in Tennessee the do not attempt to escape inspection. Th travel from Florida to-day was very light Only a few passengers from Pensacola, Fla.,
were found, all of whom had certificates fro proper authorities, and were going throug the Siat«. I gave them certificates."

"No refugees passed up the road to-day The passengers from Florida were all from th western part of the State, viz.: J. H. Carpen-
ter, aged 36, Pensacola, destination Johns-
town, Pa.; G.'W. Banfill and' wife, aged, re-
spectively, 29 and 28, destination Cincinnati;
Mrs. Chas. Everett and daughter, Leta, aged
40 and 6, destination Cincinnati. All of the had certificates from health authorities. I
find from my conversation with conductors an passengers that the quarantine is so very rigi at Montgomery, Birmingham and Decatur tha it is impossible almost for refugees to escap detection. It is my opinion that this rigi quarantine has kept many refugees from com-
ing out of Florida on the Louisville & Nash-
ville Kailroad into and through Tennessee And now that refugee trains have been put o the Savannah, Florida & Western Road by th government for the special benefit of those wh desire to leave Jacksonville, I think travel o the Louisville & Nashville over Tennessee wil not be so great, having to encounter so muc quarantine and inspection as it does in this di-
rection.

no person who is a stranger can get into th city without first subscribing to the form o oath I sent you from Macon. Steamboats ar not allowed to land their passengers and freigh on the city side of the Chattahoochee river,
but may do so at a village below the city,

Hutton to visit with him the fumigating work located two or three miles south, on the line o the Savannah, Florida & Western Railway As reported in my preceding letter, the work were idle that day because there were neithe passengers nor baggage to be inspected an handled The manner of dealing with mail matter i simply throwing "a tub to the whale," to in-
nocently deceive all sorts aud conditions o people. The process may be briefly told a follows: Letters and other mail matter ar struck with a hammer having on its face sev-
eral awl or nail-like projections which perfo-
rate the paper and merely permit the perfum of burning sulphur (from an iron pot in th center of an ordinary box car) to pass throug the little holes thus made. Let any one tr the experiment of punching a row of smal holes through several folds of writing paper,
and he will see that thereby the layers of pa-
per are held all the more tightly together. I a word, the folded letter sheet is about effect-
ually sealed against exposure to the sulphur-
ous vapor as if no perforations had been made
—the fumes only passing through the littl holes. If the method of disinfection were
250° Fah. of dry heat, as practiced by the Ten-
nessee State Board of Health, at Memphis, in
1879, or refrigeration at a temperature of 32„
Fah., then a few hours of exposure would ef-
fectually accomplish disinfection of all article of mails or baggage. But why disinfect the .
clean paper in the mails, while no thought i given the possibility that, the thousands of fil-
thy bank notes which are in circulation—man of them, no doubt, having been pocketed an handled by persons sick of yellow fever—ma with greater probability be carriers of the in-
fection? To more effectually and convenient-
ly accomplish the work of disinfection, a larg frame building, containing several rooms, is i process of erection and will be ready for us within the next few days.
I reached this city this morning, passin without difficulty the outpost where I found  trusty sentinel who was armed with a paper t which I subscribed my name, swearing that I
had not been at either of the infected places in
Florida within the last fifteen days. I me the Mayor and City Board of Health, also the
Health Officer, Dr. Morgan, and soon learne that a sharp inspection was made on all pas-
senger and freight conveyances entering th city. You may confidently rely on Macon do-
ing her duty in the matter of quarantine Yours truly,

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
or two. I could scarcely believe my own eye as I read the press dispatch that Surgeon Gen Hamilton had weakened under the pressure o an unreasonable indiguation expressed by the
Jacksonville authorities, and committed th serious blunder of revoking his order of Aug.
28, establishing Camp Perry at St. Mary's riv-
er, thirty-six miles from the stricken city,
where really handsome provisions had bee made for the care of persons who wished to ge outside of the radius of infection. The start-
ling news not only proved true, but the whole
South has become panic-stricken. Fortunate-
ly there is to be a conference with Surgeon
Gen. Hamilton this evening at Augusta, aud have already accepted an invitation from his
Excellency, Gov. Gordon, to participate in th proceedings Dr. Jerome Cochran, the distinguished san-
■ itarian of Alabama, has likewise been invite to the conference by Gov. Gordon and will g over with me. He, equally with myself, re-
grets the dangerous relaxation of the order re-
quiring all persons to be quarantined for te days at Camp Perry, where not only pure wa-
ter and good food is supplied, but a postoffic and telegraph station have been established fo the special convenience of the camp citizens For the negroes there have been erected sev-
eral hundred huts, but none of these peopl have entered them. All persons who are dis-
charged from the detention camp are give three days' rations and a clean bill of healt certificate Very respectfully,
James E. Ref.ves.
THE CONFERENCE AT AUGUSTA Auousta, Ga., September 3, 1888 Dr. J. 1). Plunket, M. D.. President Stale Board of Health, Nashville, Tumi.:
Sir: Before this reaches you you will hav read in the Associated Press dispatches th reassuring news that no more refugees from
Jacksonville will be allowed to pass out of the
State, without having been quarantined for a least ten days at one of the camps which ha been specially provided for that purpose. I few words I may tell you that the result of th conference just closed in this city will give al needful security against the spread of yello fever outside of Florida. How sorrowfully i must have been written by the authorities tha fear had taken the place of their assume bravado which for the past several weeks h been a menace and cause of great alarm to he neighboring sister cities. They themselve answer. The fact that Atlanta no longer in-
vites the bringing into her midst of person who have been exposed to the infection at
Jacksonville is proof of return to reason,
and we shall be abundantly thankful if sh does not have to repent in mourning for he folly. The supposed immunity of certai places from yellow fever is as unreliable a is the uncertainty of personal exposure t the infection, namely : because a man who ha been with the disease at one time escapes th infecton, that is no proof that he will not suc-
cumb at some future exposure when the at-
mospheric influences and feveral dependencie whatever they may be. are more favorable t its propagation.
I am sure the whole South will breath easier from the good news the press will giv in the morning. The resolutions adopte were fully discussed and unamimously ap-
proved. Surgeon-General Hamilton admitte the danger of letting out, without detentio in camp, persons so recently exposed, but gav the reason for it that the pressure for a let u from his order of August 28 seems to war-
rant the experiment. He assured the con-
ference that there should be no further im-
mediate arrivals from Jacksonville, and tha in every particular the order of August 28
would be enforced regardless of indignatio meetings and all other-influences that migh be brought forward against him because o the performance of his duty. I shall leave a midnight for Chattanooga for rest and to mak further report Your obedient servant,
James E. Reeves.

tirely, free from scarlet fever, measles, roseola,
whooping-cough, and mumps, during the mont of August. This is an exception, as one or mor of these diseases are generally on hand. Th principal disease of the month was a mild typhoi fever. A few cases were of a grave form, an two or three of them terminated fatally. Choler infantum was frequent, and diarrhoea and dysen-
tery were occasional Gibson county—Dr. T.J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—For the month of August I re-
port in my own practice a remarkably health month; remittent fever was the prevailing typ of sickness It has been remarkable, th;it ther has been but a few cases of intermittent fever a compared with the number of remittent cases One case of remittent fever terminated fatally,
after having yielded completely to quinine, car-
bolic and iodine, developing a pernicious type,
after a complete cessation for four days, In tha case there was imprudent exposure—nursing  sick child. Dysentery in adults has been secure in my own work Next in frequency, I plac bronchitis in children. I have treated a fe cases of cholera infantum. In the latter part of
July I sent postals to nearly all the physicians i the county. A tew replied. I am still endeavor-

plicated with malarial fever. One fatal case, a infant of six months. Nearly all the infants an children were attacked. The epidemic is now a an end. With that exception, August was a re-
markably healthy month. Dr. Clay, of Ruther-
ford, District 9, reports one death from dropsy Malarial fevers and diarrhoeas were the prevail-
ing diseases, but easily controlled; a health month. Dr. Caldwell, of Medina, District I, re-

Humboldt, reports not much sickness; some dys-
entery, and a few cases of biliousness. Whoop-
ing-cough all over the city; more cases of abor-
tion than usual, owing to the enervating effects o heat in the first half of the month Milan—M. D. L. Jordan, M. D.—With the e ception of a few cases of malarial fever, the tow and vicinity are healthv Trenton—A. S. Currey, Esq.—Dr. J. T. Shackle-

hood, twelve or fifteen cases have occurred wit six or seven deaths, out of the number sick. Suc a malignant form of the disease has not existed i our county for several years past. A death fro it occurred in Pulaski on the 2Sth. However, i is not epidemic here. There have been the usua number of cases of intermittent and remitten fevers in the county. One case of typhoid feve in Pulaski is reported. A child on a visit to Pu-
laski and Giles county from Nashville, wa stricken with diphtheria, taken back to Nashville,

The maximum temperatures were generall high, 98° and 99° being recorded at several sta-
tions. The minimum temperature observed was
50°, recorded on the 24th at Jacksboro. Thi was the highest August minimum during th six years, except that in 1886,52°, and 1885, 50° The mean daily ranges of temperature wer slightly less than the normal. The highes temperature was generally recorded on the

which passed over the State, with its cente in the western division, crossing the State i a north-easterly direction. While not attain-
ing the violence of a destructive tornado, it effects were very wide-spread and extende far into the eastern division. The principa damage done by this storm was to the cor crop, much of which was prostrated so tha it will be greatly damaged, if not totally lost,
by rotting. The injury or loss is estiuiated at
15 to 20 per cent High winds were reported as follows Knoxville 21st, S.W., 48 miles per hour;

Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, Oct. 16, 1888.
/. D. Plunket, M. D., President State Board of
Health:
Sir—The work of the Board during the pas quarter has been the stamping out of an incipien small-pox epidemic in July, and the isolating th entire 8tate of Tennessee from a threatened inva-
sion of yellow fever. In each instance th greatest success has ensued, proving most sat-
isfactorily the perfection of the machinery now i the sanitary service of the State Small-pox appeared in the two largest cities of
Tennessee. In a few weeks, and at a small ex-
pense, it was stifled—a very striking contrast wit any previous experience with this disease. Ou people, however, must keep wide awake, for ther are significant indications of danger during th approaching winter The yellow fever, originating in Florida an breaking out in Alabama and Mississippi, ha caused an alarm without precedent and an inter-
ruption to commerce without example. Tennessee,
from its long extended frontiers and many grea lines of transit, was peculiarly liable to invasion;
yet such has been the prompt and energetic actio of the Executive Committee in the work of in-
spection and isolation as thoroughly to preserv the entire State intact. It may be truthfully sai that this Board has thus gained a national repu-
tation for efficiency and foresight At an early day an elaborate report will be mad by the Executixe Committee. In the meantim the details of the daily operations will appear i the Bulletin The hearty co-operation of the Governor of Ten-
nessee and other State officials has been no smal help in giving the timely financial aid which wa so essential, and which had been withheld by th last General Assembly Herewith is appended a list of the contribution to the library during the past quarter:

Secretary Dr. Sims, from Committee on Prisons and
Charitable Institutions, stated that he was no engaged in preparing a full report which h had hoped to have presented to this meeting,
but would only now offer the following resolu-
tion, which was adopted:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Board, no as in the past, that by every consideration of pub-
lic policy the present system of prison managemen should be changed with as little delay as possible The present lease of the penitentiary will expir in two years, and being at variance with all en-
lightened theories of prison management, this
Board is unalterably opposed to a renewal of th lease after its termination. The present State pris-
on being wholly unsuited and insufficient for th purposes intended, and its location being a con-
stant menace to the health of the capital city o the State, the State Board of Health would recom-
mend and- earnestly urge that a new site be selecte and a new prison erected before the termination o the present lease, with a view to the abandonmen of the leaW system and the adoption of a priso and prison system in keeping with the enlightene civilization of the age Dr. Safford, from Committee on Water Sup-
ply, said he had recently visited several valuabl mineral springs in the State, and upon these, to-
gether with an investigation which he desire to soon make of the water supply of Memphi from the thirty artesian wells lately opened a that point, he would offer a full report at a early date for publication in the Bulletin Dr. Wright, from Committee on School Hy-
giene, reported great recent improvements i the heating, ventilation and sewerage of the
Clarksville public schools. He announce that he would report fully on the success o these improvements at the next meeting. H considered this announcement due the author-
ities at Clarksville, inasmuch as in a previou report he had criticised defects in said schools Dr. Plunket, from Committee on Vital Sta-
tistics, stated that he had given the subjec much careful thought and labor, as to each o the past five Legislatures he had presented

carefully prepared bills, covering a system o registration of births, marriages and deaths for
, Tennessee, and only once (April 5, 1881), di he succeed in having the subject considere favorably. This bill was, however, repeale on March 28,1883; so we are to-day practicall where this committee first begun its labors. H asked the Board for such additional instruc-
tions or suggestions as the situation required,
looking to bringing this matter before the ap-
proaching session of the General Assembly After a full interchange of views, in which al agreed to the paramount importance of thi subject, the committee was requested to perse-
vere in their efforts until success was attained Dr. Thornton, from Committee on Epidem-
ics, said the Bulletin published each mont a full report from the local health authoritie throughout the State upon the health in Ten-
nessee, but as suggested by Dr. Plunket, h would soon make a careful digest of these re-
ports covering the past three years, the perio for which they run President Plunket made a verbal report o the operation of the Quarantine established b this Board upon August 16th, and its results Not a single case of yellow fever occurred i the State during the time it was in operation Dr. Thornton offered the following resolu-
tion which, after commendatory remarks by-
each member present, was adopted unani-
mously:
Boohed, That the thanks of this Board are du and hereby tendered to Dr. J. D. Plunket, Chair-
man of the Executive Committee, for his abl and economical management of the State
Quarantine and Inspection Service during the pas summer as against the yellow fever infected local-
ities in the South Resolved, That the regular per diem pay be al-
lowed Dr. Plunket from the inauguration of thi service, August 16, to date Dr. Wright moved that Dr. Plunket be re-
quested to attend as delegate from this Boar the proposed meeting of the "Conference of
State Boards of Health," to be held in Wash-
ington, D. C, in December next Dr. Plunket stated that owing to some pri-
vate engagements, it would be impossible fo him to attend at that time Dr. Safford moved that Dr. Thornton be ap-
pointed such delegate, with Dr. Sims as alter-
nate. Adopted Dr. Thornton offered the following resolu-
tion, which was adopted:
Resolved, That this Board repeat its resolution of April 24, 1888 (see State Board of Health
Bulletin, Vol. III., No. 10, p. 116), in regard to a
National Bureau of Health, which is substantiall that the Federal Congress establish a National Bu-
reau of Health to prevent the introduction of epi-
demic diseases into this country by maratime quar-
antine, and the spread of such diseases from one
State to another,should they be introduced. Also,
that this Board now calls upon other State and lo-
cal Boards to co-operate with it through their rep-
resentatives in Congress to enact necessary laws t this end. That the Secretary of this Board be in-
structed to furnish a copy of this resolution to eac member of Congress from Tennessee, and to the
Secretary of each State Board of Health After examining and approving accounts,
the Board adjourned to meet on the first Tues-

—No report received Fayette county—Dr. W. A. Ealy, County Health
Officer, Somerville.—We have had a good deal o sickness during the month of September. Typhoid-
malarial and catarrhal fevers were the most prev-
alent diseases Fentress county—Dr. J. Bertram, County Health
Officer, Little Crab.—Health during the las month has been good. Some fever, and a fe cases of chronic diarhoea among children Franklin county—Dr. J.C. Shapard, County Health
Officer, Winchester.—Typhoid fever prevailed her quite extensively during the month of Septem-
ber. Most of the cases were of a grave type. I some the diarrhoea was severe, even uncontrolls-
ble, and in two cases there was hemorrhage fro the bowels. Several cases resulted fatally. W also had a few cases of moderately severe diph-
theria. There were only a few cases of dysenter and cholera infantum, but catarrhal afflictions,
bronchitis, tonsilitis, etc., made their advent wit the cold nights of the latter part of the month When the yellow fever refugees from Decatu commenced their flight along our road from
Huntsville to Decherd, some of our people were  little scared, but nobody was hurt. On Septtni-
ber 7th I found a negro at Decherd broken ou with small-pox. He was an employe of the Nash-
ville & Chattanooga Kailroad, had been sick fo some time, and when I saw him the corruptio was on the decline. I promptly ordered his isola-
tion and the isolation of the family with who he was stopping, and up to date (23 days) no ne cases have appeared Gibson county—Dr. T. J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—For September I would repor remarkably little sickness, and but few deaths The prevailing diseases in and around Trento have been remittent fever, intermittent fever an dysentery. Especially has the latter disease pre-
vailed among our colored population, causing tw deaths in the city limits. I treated one case o scarlatina in a family in which there were n other children. Only two children exposed to it,
and they have not yet been attacked, now nearl three weeks since exposure. I am unable to ac-
count for the appearance of this disease. I hav treated one case of chorea, and have seen one cas of elephantiasis in the person of a negro boy, a resi-
dent of this county, aged about fifteen years. On leg and foot are much enlarged. Dr. Penn, of
Humboldt, reports but little sickness of any kind Dr. Clay, of Kutherford, reports one death fro uraemia, one from typhoid fever, and one fro cancer, and adds: "The sickness has been of  mixed character, malarial fevers, diarrhoeas, con-
gestion, and some few cases of typhoid fever."

QUARANTINE Daily Reports of State Inspectors.
[Continued from Bulletin, page 31, Vol. IV.,
No. 2.]
September 4th Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "J. S. Fairhead,
aged 47 ; Mrs. H. K. Fairhead, aged 40, and their son
Floyd, from Jacksonville, Fla., were on train No.6
to day. Thev left Jacksonville on the 9th AuguBt,
and remained since that date at Middleberry and
Lawty, Fla. The fever growing worse, they wer on their way to Sioux, Dak. They had certificat stating above facts; baggage fumigated; gav them certificates and passed them on. B. L Baldwin and wife, from Ocala, Fla., and J. L
Dawes and wife, from Quincy, Fla., were also o the train going north. Their destination was Kan-
sas City and Washington, D. C. All had certifi-
cates from local health authorities. I found sev-
eral pieces of baggage from Jacksonville, some o them belonging to parties not on the train, as I
could not find owners. They were checked to St Louis and Chicago, so I let them go on."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees to-day. I met the conductors on the Memphis
& Charleston Kailroad at Corinth, Miss., who as-
sured me they did not put off any at Corinth However, I inspected all baggage at the baggag office there, as well as on the west-bound train o the same railroad. I require passengers to giv me proof of home and destination, which the readily do if they are not trying to evade the quar-
antine, either by letter addressed to them, or b sundry other ways."

SI ATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN September 5th Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "The Chatta-
nooga Board of Health now require passenger from Atlanta to this city to present properl signed certificates of health, thus closing the onl avenue by which refugees can enter this city. M inspectors are efficient and careful, and with th system adopted of having each passenger to sig an affidavit (a copy of which was sent you), statin whereabouts for the past fifteen days, etc., I ca see no possibility of a suspicious case reaching thi city. No refugees have been reported to me to-
day."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "I passe one man from Southern Georgia who had a cer-
tificate from the Alabama inspector, but h could not identify himself. He acknowledge that he lived in Florida last year. But as he wa en route to Texas, I passed him on. Rev. Kim-
mons and wife, of Fhvrida, had a certificate t the effect that he had been in Mississippi since
August 6. I passed him to Corinth, Miss., to-day,
where he used to live."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors report nothing unfavorable to-day."
September 6th On September 6th the following general orde was issued:
Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, Sept 6, 1888 It is ordered by the State Board of Health that,
until otherwise notified, no refugee from an in-
fected point be allowed to stop in Tennessee unles he or she have been in camp of detention ten days,
baggage has been disinfected, and each holds  certificate of health.
J. D. Plunk et, President Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "Dalton train,
3:50 a. m.—James Murrel left Bordman, Mario county, Flu., Sept.3; destination, (Hade Springs,
Va.; white, age 27. Had certificate from healt officer. Baggage sent on ahead without fumiga-
tion. I gave him one of our certificates. Dalto train 12:05 missed Southern connection."
Chattanooga- Inspector Lynch: "No refugee have been reported to me by the train inspector to-day."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Since m last report (September 5) the following person have been found on the trains coming Nort into our State from Florida: E Reese, white,
age 18, residence Pcnsacola, Fla., destination
Clarksville, Tenn.; C. H. Simpson, age 20, Miss
Ida Simpson, age 16, A. C. Simpson, age 18,
all white, residence Pensacola, Fla., destination
New York city; Miss Babette Smith, age 30, resi-
dence Warrington, Fla., destination New Yor city; also from Argo, Fla., I found George \V. C Littell, white, age 48, wife and three children,
Pearl, Weaver and Louise, apes40, 11, 8 and 4. I
questioned him very closely, hut he was in posses-
sion of certificates from local health authoritie properly signed and sealed; their destination was
St. Joseph, Mo. It has been several days sinc any passenger has come direct from Jacksonvill or any other yellow fever infected point over the
Louisville & Nashville Railroad into Tennessee,
and I am satisfied that it is due to the very effec-
tive local quarantine methods adopted in Florida.
I am informed by parties coming from the wester part of the State of Florida that they hav adopted a most rigid quarantine in each county,
and that they have an inspector at each count line; that they forbid any passenger from an in-
fected district coming into their midst, and tha they require parties who desire to enter the car to show certificates from health officers and other to establish the point where they started from,
and that they have not been exposed to yello fever contagion before they are admitted on th cars. This, I think, gives us in Tennessee addi-
tional security, and is one of the causes why w have so few refugees over this line."
Grand Junction—Iuspector Prewitt: "Som refugees passed West this morning. They, haw-
ever, had certificates, and as they were goin through the State I passed them."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees from
Florida have passed on trains since last report.''
Memphis—-Inspector Ford: "The Train Inspec-
tor reports nothing suspicious to-day except th following: Inspector Perry, on the Memphis A
Charleston railroad, arrived at 6:10 a. m. to-day,
reporting that he found Mr J. E. Murtha an wife and daughters, Annie, Mary, Sarah, Birdi and Maud from Jacksonville, Fla., with a certifi-
cate of health from Surgeon at a marine hospital,
stating that they had not been subject to any in-
fection for thirty days, and that they were e route to Little Rock, Ark., and that they left o the train for that place at 6:55 a. m. this day."
September 7th Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "Dalton train,
12:05 p. m., J. E Julian from Leesburg, Fla, on
Sept. 3, to Cleveland, Ohio; baggage fumigate at Dupont on the 4th— had certificate of U. S. M.
H. S. I issued him one of our certificates. Ili age was 48. Dalton train 3:50 p. m., Laura Vin-
cent from Palatka, Fla., left on Sunday last for
Indianapolis, Ind. Baggage fumigated at Dupon on the 4th; age 26. Certificate from Hutton an also from Clerk of Court. Gave her our certifi-
cate."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch : " I have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. I have instructed th inspector on the East Tennessee, Virginia A Geor-
gia Railroad that runs between here and Cleve-
land, to give Inspector Brown all the assistanc possible that he can. Passengers from Atlanta to
Chattanooga must now present properly signe health certificates or they will not be allowed t enter the city."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees to report to-day. I commend the action o the Slate Board of Health relative to refugees.*
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspec-
tors report no person or baggage from the infecte district in Florida to-day, with the following ex-
ception: Inspector Higgins, inspector on Kansas
City, Memphis & Birmingham Railroad, report two pieces of baggage checked (Nos. 51 and 74)

September 8th Cleveland—Inspector Brown : " Dalton train ha on board H. B. Phillips. Left Palatka, Florida,
Sept. 4, destination Andover, Ohio, baggage fumi-
gated at Dupont on the Bth, white, age 30. Ha certificate of local Board of Health. Issued hi a certificate myself. On same train was A. G Mcllwaine. Dalton train, 12:05 p. m —Mrs. J. B Stevenson, left Crescent City, Fla., on Sept 5, bag-
gage fumigated at Dupont on the 6th, destination
Western New York. She had a United States cer-
tificate; gave her one of our certificates; white,
age 38. All refugees I have met were white, wit the exception of a yellow nurse girl, reported las week."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "I have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. Owing to the heavy rain we have had for the past week travel from all di-
rections has been unusually light. The Chatta-
nooga quarantine officers are faithful and vigilan and are obeying instructions to the letter. Th system we have adopted is an excellent one an nothing short of an entire stoppage of all trave could be very effective. I am constantly going ou upon the various trains that come into this cit and I find the trainmen always ready and willin to give me all the information they can. I do no hesitate to say that it is as difficult for a refuge to enter Chattanooga as it is for a camel to pas through the eye of a needle."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Since last re-
port Joseph Gault, white, age 21 from Ocala, Fla.,
destination Robinson, III.; Thos. V. Porter, white,
age 36, residence Gainesville, Fla., destination
Evansville, Ind., passed over this line. They ha certificates, and I issued them our certificate an passed them on. On the early train this morning
I found Emma McCardell and five children, Rich-
ard, Agnes, Edward, Anna and Laura, aged, re-
spectively, 48, 15, 10, 8, 5 and 3 years. They ha no certificates or evidence that they were from St Andrews Bay, Fla., but I found from the bag-
gageiuaeter that their baggage was checked fo bt. Paul, Minn., and I let (hem go on, as the were not going to stop in the State. Also I found
E. A. Wallace, from Pensacola, Fla., age 28, white,
destination Evansville, Ind. Otherwise nothin suspicious has been found."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Passe men west and north to-day from South Georgi and Alabama, where they had certificates and ev-
idence to prove they had not been in Florida i ten or fifteen days. I was inclined to the belie that a few of them were indeed aMid truth Florid-
ians. As the west bound train was late we did no reach the Junction until 8 p. in."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees wer found on trains of either of the roads under m inspection on yesterday's trip."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors report nothing from Florida to-day except th transit of the two pieces of baggage alluded to i my report of 7th inst., being stamped or labeled,
'Fumigated at Gattman, Miss., on 7th inst.' I
saw them transferred to the Kansas City depot Train Inspector O'Brien on the Louisville & Nash Railroad reported a consignment of household ef-
fects shipped from Atlanta, Ga., to Mrs. L. B Dantigue, Memphis, Tenn. The articles came o freight train and were held for further investiga-

DR. JAS. E. REEVES,
of Chattanooga, whom the State Board of Healt sent to make investigatious concerning the quar-
antine regulations and sanitary condition through
Georgia, sent in the following report:
Chattanooga, Tenn., Sept. 8,1888.
J. D. Ptunkel, M.D., President State Board of Health,
Nashville, Tenn.:
Sir—I am sure I shall never cease to be thank-
ful for the providential opportunity given me o participating in the conference at Augusta on
Monday evening, the 4th inst., between his Excel-
lency, Gov. Gordon, of Georgia, and Surgeon-Gen-
eral Hamilton, of the Marine Hospital Service The arrangement for the conference, because of th emergency of the situation, was the work of bu a day—in fact, of but a few hours by telegraph,
and if my movements from place to place had bee less rapid I should have missed the very clima of opportunity to represent the State Board of
Health of Tennessee in its industrious efforts t prevent yellow fever from finding a lodgment with-
in our border. If the terms of the fair under-
standing with Surgeon-General Hamilton ar faithfully regarded, namely, that all persons from
Jacksonville and oiher infected localities in Flor-
ida, shall be detained in quarantine for ten days,
and that all articles whatsoever of baggage an clothing or other personal effects of the travele shall be thoroughly disinfected, and after this  certificate shall be furnished by the commandin officer of the quarantine camp or station settin forth the above-named facts, then there need b no fear of yellow fever in Tennessee. Besides th well organized precautions embodied in the orde of the Surgeon-General of the Marine Hospital,
bearing date of Aug. 28, and reaffirmed at the con-
ference at Augusta, it should be remembered tha up to the present date yellow fever does not pre-
vail in epidemic form in Florida outside of Jack-
sonville. Indeed, with the well-known few excep-
tions, the State of Florida was never more gener-
ally healthy than at present; yet, owing to th universal panic among its citizens, there is com-
plete obstruction to travel; even from county t county and town to town, in districts more than  hundred miles away from Jacksonville, Tampa,
Manatee, Plant City and other points at whic cases of yellow fever have been reported. Me-
thodical, sensible, humane quarantine in man towns and counties has given way very nearly t mob violence in the midst of the general confusion At many cross-roads and other dangerous point the shotgun quarantine is the influence whic prevents freedom of travel, either pedestrian,
horseback or railway. Independent of county an municipal quarantines and shotgun volunteers,
there are stationed at all the outlets of railwa lines, north and west, careful inspectors appointe by the Marine Hospital Service, and a perfect sys-
tem of passes, even from healthy localities, is in

force, and the surveillance is day by day becom-
ing more and more effective Outside of the Florida line, at all of the citie and towns wherever the traveler goes, inspector are on the watch, so that it is almost impossibl for a Floridian or any person from that Stat within the last fifteen days, unless by certificat of discharge from quarantine, to get into Tennes-
see. Even Atlanta, notwithstanding the idle,reck-
less boast that yellow fever cannot be propagate within her limits, has maintained a secret, clos watch for suspects and had hospital physician,
ambulance and nurses, all ready for the care o the first case. Now, however, the authorities o that city seem unwilling to longer bare thei bosoms to the merciless infection and are becom-
ing anxious for the public safety. In proof, se the following dispatches sent yesterday:
"Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 7.—The following dis-
patch was sent to-day: Surgeon-General Hamil-
ton: Atlanta relies upon the Camp Perry quaran-
tine and the decision of the Augusta conference Can we depend upon direct official notice fro you in case this plan should be modified o changed? Answer.
"James B. Baird,
"Secretary Board of Health."
With Atlanta's return to reason, the States of
Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi,
have all the safeguards that can possibly b thrown around them. Finding such complete in-
spection of all railway passengers to Waycross,
Jessup, Brunswick, Macon, Columbus and othe stations, I deemed it unnecessary to go into South
Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi for the pur-
pose of observing their systems of quarantine,
State, county and municipal, and was on my re-
turn home, when I heard at Atlanta of the com-
ing of forty passengers direct from Jacksonville,
and of the godsend of the conference next day at
Augusta.
I have entire confidence in the quarantine no in force in South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabam and Tennessee, and in all Georgia, save Atlanta The State statutes, county and municipal regula-
tions, are of course matters of public record, an may be easily studied. If they are defective any-
wise in their texts, they are tolerably sound i practice (?) to meet the present emergency Your letter addressed to nie at Waycross—als telegram to the same place-—did not catch m there. The letter followed me to Chattanooga,
but the telegram, notwithstanding my instruction to forward, was not delivered. Your message, ad-
dressed to me at Atlanta, was received while I wa on the train for Augusta. I believe I have don all that was necessary to carry out in spirit you letter of instructions, and really consider it ver fortunate that I missed your communications b letter and telegraph, if, in obeying them, I shoul have missed the conference at Augusta, for it wil never be known generally how near a negativ and fruitless result was escaped Finally, let me congratulate the State Board of
Health of Tennessee on the success of its intelli-
gent labors. In none of the sister States is ther to be found a wiser or more economical adminis-
tration of the public health service. Your intel-
ligent, careful work is recognized by every Stat in the Union, and it deserves far more liberal sup-
port by the State Legislature than it has yet re-
ceived. Thus far the special energies of the boar in preventing the extension of yellow fever to this
State have been worth millions of dollars to it citizens; and if the season shall pass without  case of the disease in Tennessee all classes of peo-
ple may thank the State Board of Health for thei escape. With this report I consider the duties o my commission from the board to have been ac-
complished; and if, by the personal sacrifice I
made to accept your agency, I have contribute by my service to the success of the work of vou department, and through it to the welfare of th people of my adopted State, all is well. Here-
with find statement of my necessary expenses an accompanying vouchers Your obedient servant,

consultation with Dr. Thornton, President of the
City Board of Health, this forenoon, concerning  rumor of suspicious fever at Galloway, or nea there, on the Louisville & Nashville Kailroad, i this county, resulted in his requesting me to go u and investigate. I leave this evening at 5:20, re-

ville, Fla., left there in June, spending summer a some resort in East Tennessee, was held for in-
spection here to-day; having certificate from Chat-
tanooga and baggage checked from there she wa passed to Covington, Tenn. A drummer from
New York city, via Atlanta, Montgomery and
New Orleans, traveling without a certificate, wa reported by Inspector Mahon on the Mississippi
& Tennessee Railroad, and was furnished with  certificate. Rumor as to Birmingham is false Except as above, the inspectors report everythin satisfactory to-day. The suspicious case at Gal-
loway was one of malarial hematuria. Part from Coahoma county, Mississippi; had not bee to Florida. When I boarded the train returning,
Inspector Delany, the inspector, said that th alarm was at Mason, a few ni'les north of Gallo-
way. I wrote to Dr. J. J. Elcan, at Mason, to lear the facts, hoping to hear from him by the 13th Dr. Thornton, President City Board of Health,
and I are satisfied that the rumor originated fro the case at Galloway, the sick man being fou miles east of Galloway and about five miles south-
east of Mason. Said sick man is at the house o his father-in-law, Mr. Porter, whose son has re-
covered from an attack of malarial (typho-ma-
larial so called) fever, with which he was stricke the day he got home from Tampa, Fla., about the
19th ult. He bad had a malarial attack befor leaving Florida, became alarmed at the yello fever and made the trip in such a feeble conditio as to induce a relapse. Will inform you of Dr Elcan's report."

Health. He says he is on business, and not a ref-
ugee. Baggage not fumigated; sent on before. I
gave certificate. Dalton train 3:50 missed connec-
tion, or some Jacksonville people would hav been aboard, so the conductor said; will be on th lookout."

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLE1IN Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "While sittin in the telegraph office at the depot this morning,
awaiting the arrival of the train due here at 4:37
a. m., a message passed over the wires sayin there was a case of yellow fever at Decatur. Th operator reported it to me, and I immediatel wired the Mayor of Decatur, and at noon receive a telegram saying that the patient died of ureami poisoning. I have instructed my inspectors, a directed by you in telegram received at 10
a. m. to-day, to allow no Decatur people t stop in this city until further orders. To-day,
upon the arrival of the East Tennessee, Vir-
ginia & Georgia railroad train that reache here at 5:40 a. m., my inspector reported th following refugees to me: W. I. Walker am wife, from Camp Perry, en route to Chicago;
Miss Winnie Walker, age 13, from Camp Perry,
en route to Chicago. The baggage belonging t them had been fumigated. These parties ha been in Florida (Camp Perry) within the las fifteen days, and had stopped over in Cleveland Inspector Brown granted them certificates, and o the strength of that my inspector allowed the to enter this city and change cars here. Trave on the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia rail-
road (main line) has been so heavy for the pas few days that it has been almost impossible fo one man to work the train, consequently I put a extra inspector on that train to-day. The 11:40
p. m. train on the Western & Atlantic Railroa has just arrived, and the inspector reports that  large party of refugees will be on the next train.
I go to Dalton to assist the inspector on tha train, and will return at 4:37 a. m. The Memphis
& Charleston Railroad train, due here at 9:50 p.m.,
is late, and I will report it to-morrow."
Pulaski — Inspector Abernathy: "Since las report no refugees have passed over my line. O the early train this morning I received intelli-
gence that a man had died in Decatur on las night at 9 o'clock, and that he had some symp-
toms of yellow fever, also that a man from Jack-
sonville, Fla., had stayed all night with hi in Decatur about two weeks ago. This informatio aroused some suspicion in my mind, and I boarde the 10:30 a. m. train for Decatur, arriving'there at
12:30 p. m. I found the town panicked, and sev-
eral people took the first trains out. As soon as I
arrived in Decatur I went immediately to Dr Cross'office (who is the health officer of Decatur),
and was consulting physician to the man that died The facts, as ascertained from Dr. Cross, are a follows: On the 17th day of August a Mr. Law-
rence came to Decatur and represented that h came from Atlanta. He stopped with an ac-
quaintance and friend, by the name of A. D Spencer. Subsequent investigation disclosed th fact that he had come from Jacksonville, Fla., di-
rect, so the corporate authorities forced Mr. Law-
rence to leave Decatur. While there he slept i the same room with Mr. A. D. Spencer. Afte leaving Decatur, Lawrence wrote to Spencer from
Kansas City that he was well, and, was a fe days ago, when he was again heard from. On
September 6th A. D. Spencer was taken ill, wit the following symptoms, as I gathered them from
Drs. Bowman and Cross, who attended him: Dys-
enteric discharges from his bowels, which Dr Bowman thought hemorrhoidal, sick stomach,
which was non-retentive of food and medicine al through the sickness until time of death. Th man did not have a high temperature, it register-
ing only 101 degrees Fah. the highest. The doc-
tors represent symptoms of great prostration fo three days before death, and 24 hours before deat there was a total suppression of urine, and befor death the man was comatose, and died after hav-
ing several convulsions. His stomach rejecte everything put upon it, and a few hours befor death he ejected from the stomach a discolore matter very much like black vomit. However, i is proper to mention that he was given, a whil before vomiting this matter, blackberry brandy,
and this may have discolored the vomit. Ther was a jaundiced condition of his skin and con-
junctiva;; but Dr. Cross, who took charge of th corpse, said, after death, the yellow hue of th skin diminished. This case was either yello fever or a bilious remittent of a malignant type As to which of the two, with the lights before me,
I am unable to determine. However, I inclin to the opinion that it is of malarial origin. Dr Cochran, of the State Board of Health of Ala-
bama, came to Decatur this afternoon, also Dr Dozier, of Birmingham, and Dr. Dement, of
Huntsville, Ala , to investigate the matter. I
shall go there to-morrow to make further investi-
gation. After the death of the man Dr. Cros had everything in the way of bedding and wear-
ing apparel in the room burned, and the roo most thoroughly fumigated. The wife and chil-
dren were sent to Huntsville, Ala., this afternoon One of the children was taken with fever on las evening, hut was much better this morning. Wan of time prevents me from giving a more detaile and correct account of this case, but I will get al the information on to-morrow's visit, and will b able to come to a more definite conclusion as t the true nature of this case. While the prepon-
derance of symptoms would argue against yello fever, this case is not without suspicion."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No ref-
ugees to report to-day. I received your dispatc upon reaching the Junction at 6. p. m. I had al-
ready anticipated it, having heard of the suppose case (at Corinth, Miss.) Twelve physicians makin the post mortem, and eight to four against yello fever I am inclined to believe it is a false alarm,
since it was a citizen of the place, not a refugee Dr. Thornton goes up to-day to investigate th matter, as per your request."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees from
Florida points to-day."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No unfavorabl reports to-day from train inspectors. Two trunk are held up, as shown by report of Inspector De-
laney, on Louisville & Naslfville railroad. The were checked from Chattanooga, and there was n one on the train with tickets to correspond."
September 13th Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "Dalton train

cate from health officer Putnam county; age, 55;

Waycross. 1 always persuade refugees to go by
Kooxrille instead of Chattanooga when I can Thin is the first person I could not influence. I
would have been more persistent had not the
Chattanooga train been under inspection."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "LaBt night,
upon the arrival of the Memphis & Charleston
Railroad train, my inspector reported that h had put off fifteen Decatur people at the tow of Stevenson, Alabama. Thinking that thes people would attempt to enter the city via the
Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railroad I im-
mediately sent a man to Cravens to intercep them. When the Nashville train entered th depot officers boarded each coach and would le nobody out until I inspected the train. I discov-
ered six Decatur people and put them on the
Western & Atlantic Railroad train and sent the through to Atlanta. To-day the inspector on the
Memphis & Charleston Railroad put oft' five De-
caturites at Carpenter's Station, Ala., one o whom had a hard chill. Later on I received  telegram from the Memphis & Charleston Rail-
road's passenger agent asking if these peopl would be allowed to pass through Chattanooga e route to Asheville, N. C. I wired they could no enter this city. All trains have been ordered t pass Decatur without stopping. No boats ply be-
tween this city and Decatur at present. To-day I
put three inspectors on the Nashville road and in-
structed them to stop all Decatur passengers. I
have also placed two extra inspectors on the Mem-
phis & Charleston Railroad. Inspecting the Nash-
ville road gives me five more trains to meet, thu keeping me up at all hours of the day and night.
I doubt very much whether I will be able to en-
dure the loss of rest, but I will try. I went to
Dalton last night expecting to find some Florid refugees, but found none."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "I found o to-day's trains R. H. Lukenbill, aged 21, white,
and J. R. Hawkins, white, aged 35, from Fer-
nandina, Fla. They both had certificates prop-
erly signed, and were destined for Cincinnati, O Issued State Board of Health certificate to each Also found E. L. Green, from Milton, Fla., wh also had a certificate; issued him our certifi-
cate; his age was 17; destination, Lexington,
Va. All is confusion below now. Since th announcement of Dr. Cochran, that Spence died of yellow fever, Decatur has been mor panicked than ever, and last night a larg number of people left on the trains out. To-da no trains have been allowed to stop in Decatur o the Louisville & Nashville line. Still some hav gotten out of Decatur and taken trains from sta-
tions near Decatur. Maj. Geddes, Superintendent,
has arranged a 'terminal' at Harris Station,  few miles north of Decatur, and changing of en-
gines will take place there instead of at Decatur Now, no train is allowed to Btop at Decatur o this line, and this will be kept up so long as ther is any danger. Athens, Ala., will put on a rigi quarantine against Decatur to-night at 0 o'clock,
and I am informed that several other Alabam towns near there have already done so. I did no go to Decatur to-day, as I anticipated, because 1
learned from the conductor of the train that h had orders not to stop his train in Decatur, so I
could not get off. I learn that an autopsy wa had on the remains of Spencer and that fourtee physicians were present. After hearing a state-
ment of the history of the case and the autopsy  vote was taken, nine being of the opinion that i was not yellow fever and five voting that it was Among the latter number was Jerome Cochran,
M. D., State Health Officer of Alabama, whoB opinion has already been published."

gees to report to-day, either from Florida or Deca-
tur, Ala."

tion of owner was called for to-day. The partie had certificate from Inspector Lynch."

Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "My inspect-
or on the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia
Railroad (main line) reports that he put off at
Sherman Heights a man named Anogest, wh could not give a satisfactory account of himself;
thiB man claimed to be from Macon, Ga., but th inspector had reason to believe that he was from
McClenny, Fla.; he boarded the Cincinnati trai at Boyce for Mansfield, O. The inspector on the
Memphis & Charleston Railroad reports that h put off at Wauhatchie H. A. Sparrow, aged 53,
from Decatur, Ala. This man came by boat from
Decatur to Bridgeport, and boarded the train a the last named station. A boat is expected t reach here next Sunday from Decatur. I tele-
graphed its Captain that it would not be allowe to land here. I shall watch it and see that it doe not land at this city. I am exercising the greates vigilance and hope to keep refugees away fro here."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "No refugee from Florida up to this hour. The people wh left Decatur on the 2:30 morning train were prin-
cipally Northern people going through the State."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Befor reaching the Junction this evening I discovered
Mrs. T. H. McKinzey and three children from De-

ticle in to-day's Memphis Appeal relative to a
Memphian passing all the inspectors, if intende to include me, I denounce, for none escape me,
unless they are vouched for by some one known t me, or who has proved himself all right. I tak no certificate as conclusive proof of where the have been for past ten or twelve days. Supt. Pe-
gram, conductors and quite a number of Memph-

Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Train inspector report nothing unfavorable or suspicious to-day,
unless the following report of Inspector Delaney,
on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, be so con-
sidered: 'I arrived here from Milan at 5:15 a. m.
I have no suspicion whatever that anybody was o the train from Florida or Decatur, Ala. I ques-
tioned all the passengers very closely. I examine baggage reports and conductor's tickets, one o which was marked 'Florida Southern Railroad.'
The owner, a sleeping-car passenger and a travel-
ing man, was willing to swear he bought the ticke at Nashville from a scalper. He was very posi-
tive in his statements. I feel confident all waasat-

tificate. This man has a certificate from Atlanta,
which city lie left about 36 hours since, but ha none from Florida. I can certify that Mr. Will-
iams was on east-bound train No. 16 on about the
30th or 31st of last month, en route from Jackson-
ville to Louisville, Ky., as you will find by my re-
port of that date."
Chattanooga—Ins|>ector Lynch: "No refugee to report to-night. It is reported here to-day tha a suspicious case exists at Wildwood, Ga., a statio on the Alabama Great Southern Railroad. I g there to-morrow to investigate it. I am enforcin the quarantine against Decatur, but as the trains d not stop there, very few Decatur people come thi way. 1 have telegraphed that no steamboat from Decatur would be allowed to land here."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Received  telegram this 8 a. m., that no new c:i9e of feve had developed in Decatur, from the State Healt officer, Cochran, and things are quieting dow very much there. About 2,000 people have lef the town. A coach filled with people from Dec tur passed up the road yesterday afternoon. I
did not know of this until after the train ha started from Decatur. Several had certificate from Health Officer Cross, but others did not pro-
cure them, as they did not have the time. Al claimed that they had no ex(>osure to the man
Spencer, and many of them I know, and coul trust their statements. Below 1 furnish the name of those from Decatur who stopped in Tennessee:
Lewis Taylor, colored, age 40, destination Bed-
ford's Station; Mrs. J. J. West and children,
white, age 32, Nashville; Mrs. Martha Mershon,
white, 40, Nashville; B. B. Adams, white, 29,
Nashville; F. Pollard, white, 25, Nashville; Katie
Jackson and child, colored, 20 and 1, Columbia;
J. G. Cross, wife and child, white, 30 and 28,
Nashville; Bridget Maxwell, white, 17, Nashville;
Bob Lacroix, white, 13, Nashville; George Fin-
ney, white, 27, Nashville. From Florida the fol-
lowing passengers: Mrs. Anna Sexaul, age 40,
white, destination I-ouisville; Mrs. J. F. Kwin and son, white, ages 48 and 10, from Orange City,
Fla., destination Chicago. All had certificates Since writing this morning I went down to Harris'
Station, intending to go into Decatur, but after ar-
riving there I found no transportation over. Dr Cochran was there (Harris'), having come to estab-
lish a fumigating station at that point. All mail are brought out of Decatur to Harris', and ther fumigated. Dr. Cochran is hopeful over the situa-
tion at Decatur, and stated to me emphaticall that there was no other new cases in Decatur The fact that no new cases have been develope as yet from Spencer, four days having elapse since his death, is encouraging to say the least Ten days will, more than likely, decide the ques-
tion as to the spread of the disease, and four o these days have passed. In interviewing Dr Cochran as to those who were directly exposed t the sick man Spencer, he said about twenty-on persons came in actual contact with Spencer, an ten others, indirectly, were exposed. Those wh were directly exposed have been put under a rigi quarantine, and will not be allowed to leave De-
catur until all danger of an outbreak of th disease in them is positively decided These people being under the observation of
Dr. Cochran and Health Officer Cross, an quarantined from outside communication, I
think people may leave Decatur without dange of spreading the disease; so I have allowe a nnml>er of people from Decatur to come into
Tennessee. Health Officer Cross issued certificate to people on yesterday, but he now tells them tha it is unnecessary to have them, as all persons ex-
posed are under watch and quarantine. From
Florida I found to-day Willis Pulling, white,
age 41, from Madison county, Fla., destination
Cincinnati; James H. Lesby, white, age 30,
from Sumpter county, Fla., destination Scot-
land; D. fi. Kimmel, wife and two children,
ages 34, 29, 4 and 3, from Sparr, Fla., destination
Waterville, Kas.; J. V. Fairhead, white, age 39,
from Middleberg, Fla., destination Utica, N. Y.

Mr. Fairhead left Jacksonville on the 6th of Aug-
ust and came to Middleberg, and has been ther since. He had certificates stating these facts, an that he was from Middleberg. However, I am in-
clined to regard him with some suspicion. As h was passing through the State I let him go on All the above-named parties had certificates prop-
erly sealed and signed. Mayor W. D. Chipley' wife and children, from Pensacola, were on th train en route for Cincinnati."

Florence, Ala., and luka, Miss. All were pro-
vided with certificates and vouchers fully authen-
ticated. I could not inspect No. 1 train this a.m.,
as it was seven hours late. However, I got the
Memphis officer to go up with me until we met it,
and he inspected it."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "Found on Mobile

fore leaving a telegram was received announcin the patient's death, and I did not go. The patien was a man named Wilson, who came to Wild woo from Decatur a few days ago. The case look rather suspicious. I have no other cases to repor to-night. Travel on all lines is unusually light The detention stations at Boyce and Sherman
Heights have heen removed to Citico, just beyon the city limits. This move was made by the Chat-
tanooga Board of Health in order to satisfy th citizens of Boyce and Sherman Heights, who pro-
tested vigorously against the detention of refugee at these points."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "On to-day' trains I only found Geo. Lardner, white, age 29,
residence River Junction, Fla., destination Louis-
ville, Ky. Certificate sealed and signed properly;
issued State Board of Health certificate to him In the baggage car I found a trunk from Waldo,
Fla., checked to Cincinnati, O. This piece of bag-
gage came over the 1 Fla Railway & Navigation
Co.'9 road. It must have come to Baldwin an through McClenny to River Junction. It had a Fla Railway & Navigation road check, and the prob-
lem with me was how it got through. I inspecte the train from baggage car to sleeper, and wit the aid of conductor and baggage-master was una-
ble to find the owner. Perhaps he was put off. I
did not know whether or not it had been fumigated,
as no owner was found, and as it was goin through the State let it pass on. There are no ne developments at Decatur as yet, and the excite-
ment is subsiding. Athens, I am informed by May-
or Lane, will raise her quarantine to-day."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees encountered to-day. The Decatur and Bir-
mingham alarm has about subsided; nevertheless
I think it of vital import to be extremely watch-
ful until all danger is past—rather until frost."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "On Mobile & Ohio
Railroad north-bound yesterday found Mr. John
Milne, white, age 17, from Chattanooga, through
Decatur, to Eddyville, Ky. Had certificate from

ville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railroad train to-
night at 9:50. lie claims to have left Jacksonvill thirty days ago. He has been in Atlanta and

Daly, on Louisville & Nashville Railroad, arrive at 4 p. m., reporting two pieces of baggage from
Waldo, Fla., destined for Kansas. They wer checked Nos. 1255 and 970, and were put off at

U. S. officers at Live Oak. Issued certificates t the above parties. I am running on two nigh and one day train at present, so that I may assis in maintaining the Chattanooga quarantine."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch : "T have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. Travel from Florid has been unusually light for the past few days. I
was very much surprised to-night to find no in-
spector on the Nashville train that reaches thi city 9:50 p. m. Upon investigation I found tha the trains passed at Bolivar instead of Stevenson,
as usual. I immediately hunted up the conductor,
and he reports that most, of the passengers wer from Nashville."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No ref-
ugees to-day. I continue to run up to Corinth,
Miss., every day. It enables me to make rigi examination without delaying the trains."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "Two pieces of bag-
gage from Waldo, Fla., checked to Emporia, Kas ,

tion. It had not been fumigated, so far as known On the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, yesterday, found
Mr. J. A. Davis, white, age 45, from Macon, Ga.,
to Paris; Tenn. No certificate. I was satisfied,
from evidence, that he had not been exposed t yellow fever."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Inspector Perry,
on Memphis & Charleston Railroad, reported yes-
terday Mr. A. G. Shuford, from Gainesville, Ga.,
traveling with health certificate. I learned to-da that it was a mistake, and that Mr. Shuford wa from Gainesville, Fla. I found him with certifi-
cate from clerk of court, and from Marine Hos-
pital Surgeon at Waycross, both dated 15th inst He resides ten miles south of Gainesville, an was in that town only about two hours awaitin train. I did not regard him dangerous, but Dr Thornton, President of the City Board of Health,
thought differently, and has ordered his departur to-night. Mr. Shuford told me he would go fro here to Murfreesboro, Tenn., if he did not suc-
ceed in buying mules here, and that he expecte to leave to-night or to-morrow. Inspector Pen-y als reports Mr. W. B. Wright and wife, of Decatur,
Ala , arriving here to-day on health certificate of
Dr. Lowry, of Huntsville, obtaining it there an paving one dollar for it. Mr. W. and wife wer ordered to leave to-night. With the above excep-
tions, nothing worthy of mention has been re-
ported to me. I had notice from Inspector Jordan,
at Milan, of the transit back of trunks alluded t in my report of 17th. Dr. Thornton, Presiden of the City Board of Health, informs me that Mr Shuford will leave to-night on the 10 p. m. trai for Murfreesboro, over the Louisville & Nashville

September 16th, for Knoxville, Tenn.; had cer-
tificate from the Mayor and Board of Health, an one from the Live Oak authorities regarding bag-
gage. I have been informed that some Jackson-
ville refugees (without certificates) already re-
ported, had passed the guard and escaped th quarantine at Camp Perry."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "Train in-
spectors report that with the following exceptio they have encountered no refugees to-day: In-
spector on the Memphis & CharUston Railroa to-day put off at Bridgeport, Ala., O. Holder,
from Decatur, Ala., age 23, height 5feet 10 inches;
soft brown complexion, light hair and mustache At time he was put off he wore a black frock coa and light pants. Travel from the South has bee unusually light for the past 24 hours."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "On yesterday
I found on the trains from Florida, H. C. Bailey,
colored, age 35, from Leon county, Fla , destina-
tion Nashville, Tenn. He had certificates signe and sealed properly; issued him ours. From De-
catur, I found Geo. McCoy, age 21, white. H was going to Nashville. On asking him if he wa exposed to Spencer or Kibby, he said that h was afraid of them, and had not been near them He had no certificate, and further said that th doctor told him it was unnecessary to procur one. I let him pass, believing that he told m the truth as to exposure to the men who died. I
also found from Decatur, A. A. Lischenberger,
white, age 24, destination Mt. Vernon, Ind.; H.
W. Howard, wife and son, white, ages 43, 40 and
10 respectively; had certificates from Dr. Cross Destination Cincinnati, Ohio. Since the death of
O. O. Kibby, of suspected yellow fever, and th reported case, at Wauhatchie, the excitement is in-
creasing, especially in Limestone county, whic has quarantined rigidly against Decatur. The

railroad agent at Pulaski has orders not to sel tickets to any point below Athens. The rumo being prevalent this morning that the nurse wh waited on Kibby had sickened and died last night,
I telegraphed to 15. F. Cross to wire me the fact in the case, and received the following: "Kibby' nurse is not sick. No suspicious symptoms." So I
take it there are no new developments since
Kibby's death, which I am informed by the ver highest authority was caused by yellow fever. Th telegram of Dr. Cross induces me to the belie that Decatur has not aR yet become an infecte point, and I hope for the best. Being unable t go further South than Athens, I must rely on th telegraph lines for information. However, I wil do my best to keep you informed of any new de-
velopments there. I wired Dr. Cross that I woul nut pass into our State any other person from
Decatur who did not have a certificate fro him a* Health Officer, that they had not been ex-
posed to Spencer or Kibby. At M o'clock p. m Inspector Abernatliy wrote the following: "I hav just received a telegram from Jerome Cochran,
State Health Officer of Alabama, now tit Decatur,
in response to my telegram to Health Officer
Cross, of Decatur, which is as follows: 'Kibby' nnrse has not been sick. We have one case unde observation.' I take it that this is very ominous Another case in Decatur after the two alread there, would look very much like an infected cen-
ter. I found on the train this afternoon, J. M Tarble and wife, white, ages 54 and 25, from Pen-
sacola, Fla., destination Chicago, III.; had certifi-
cates; issued ours to them. Also from near De-
catur, Henry Westtrfall, wife and infant, white,
atres 25 and 21 years and 7 months respectively They had no certificates, and as they were goin through the State I let them pass on. Their des-
tination was Greenville, Ohio. Will wire you i anything alarming occurs at Decatur."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: l: No ref-
ugees to-day. I find it necessary to even go be-
hind the seats in the cars for refugees. It is  mortifying confession that men will lend their in-
fluence in thus practicing deception. No longe than yesterday a man had a certificate certifyin that he had been in town two months, to his knowl-
edge, and I found out, by papers in his possession,
lie had been there only four weeks."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "On 11:30 a. m.
train, Louisville & Nashville Railroad to Mem-
phis, I found J. T. Cross and wife and daughter,
white, ages 35, 25 and 5 years, from Decatur, Ala.;
had certificates signed by Dr. Cross, Health Offi-
cer at Decatur, Ala. Had tickets and baggag checked from Nashville to Humboldt, Tenn After receiving your dispatch, having previousl notified them, I told them they must leave to-day,
which they have done, Mr. Cross returning to De-
catur, hia wife and daughter going to Kentucky."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Inspector Daly,
on Louisville & Nashville Railroad, reports tw men as suspicious on his train this afternoon. Th men were railroad laborers from Cairo, III., goin to Lei and, Miss. Inspector Jordan left word thi morning for Inspector Daly, at Milan, that one o them was from Florida (Jacksonville). Both me claimed a case of mistaken identity. They wer eent under surveillance to depot on way to Leland With this exception, nothing suspicious has bee reported to me to-day."

Chattanooga quarantine officer last week, die with black vomit at Wildwood,Ga.,last night, thre miles from here and nine from Chattanooga. At-
tending physician telegraphed Mayor Nicklin, of
Chattanooga, for physician to examine the case Mayor Nicklin would have nothing to do with it People here are excited and condemn Chattanoog officials in strong terms for thrusting refugees fro infected districts on a small village and then re-
fusing to send physician when a case of yellow fe-
ver develops. Excitement is very high, and threat of violence are freely made if it is not stopped a once. Can you do anything for us in the way o suggesting a course to pursue? Answer quick Signed: J. H. Light, J. P., S. E Rowden, P. M.,

J. D. Ptunket, MI)., President State Board of Health,
Ha»hiille, Tenn.:
Sir—In obedience to the commission from vou honorable Board of Health, dated Sept 17th, 1888,
directing me to proceed at once to Wildwood,  station on the Alabama Great Southern Railroad,
in Dade county, Ga., and investigate the circum-
stances attending the recent death of Fleming
Wilson at that place, and if possible determin the nature of his disease, I have the honor to re-
port that, taking the first train I arrived at Wau-
hatchie about 9:30 o'clock that night, and was cor-
dially received by Dr. S. R. Deakins and othe prominent citizens of Wanhatchie and vicinity About midnight Dr. Lynch, the State Inspector at
Chattanooga, called to see me. Early the nex morning I went over to Wildwood, three or fou miles distant, and carefully examined into all th facts and circumstances relative to the illness an death of Mr. Wilson, returned to Wanhatchi about noon and briefly communicated with yo by telegraph, and returned to Nashville by "th evening train. The facts obtained are briefly a follows: Mr. Fleming Wilson had been living an working in Decatur, Ala., for some months past,
hiswife remaining in Chattanooga. It is suppose that Wilson on being taken sick at Decatur mad an effort to reach his wife; at any rate he was pu off the train at Stevenson, Ala , about 8 p. m., on
Wednesday night, the 12th inst., by the Chatta-
nooga train inspectors, and he remained on th platform all night. The next morning (Thurs-
day; he boarded a train going in the direction of
Chattanooga, and was again put off the train at
Carpenter's station by the same inspectors. A fe hours later he boarded another train snd was p off about noon by the seme inspectois at Wan

hatchie, where lie remained about two hours,
when he was placed in a wagon and taken to rela-
tiveH at Wildwood. That night Dr. Dcakins wa called to nee him, and attended him professionall until his death on Saturday night.following (the
15th inst.) He was buried the afternoon of th following day. The Doctor soon realized the fac that he had in Mr. Wilson a very suspicions case,
if not positive yellow fever. After refreshing hi memory a little about a case of yellow fever h treated some years since and com paring symptoms,
he was not long in deciding that Mr. Wilson ba yellow fever. After a careful analysis of Mr. Wil-
son's symptoms, as given by this clear-headed an experienced physician, including suppression o urine and black vomit during the last six hours o life, together with the general appearance of hi patient before and after death. I unhesitatingl express the opinion that Mr. Wilson died of yel-
low fever. Mr. Wilson stated before leaving
Wauhalchie that he had fever when ejected fro the train at Stevenson, and Dr. Dcukins says ther was no intermission in his fever during his illness About a dozen persons were exposed to the conta-
gion during Wilson's illness. All measures of iso-
lation, disinfection, burning of infected bedding,
clothing, etc., deemed necessary, have been take and ordered, and will be carried out by Dr. Dea-
kins as fully as possible. I found the people of
Wauhatchie and Wildwood and vicinity very muc excited and indignant at the train inspectors fo putting off yellow fever victims among them, a they are wholly unprepared to receive and care fo these unfortunates without direct contact wit their own families, and fresh victims in their ow households. As suggested in my telegram to you,
and in my conversation with Dr. Lynch, a statio should be established and maintained west of Chat-
tanooga, where all suspected persons can be sen and detained the usual time, making them as com-
fortable as possible. In conclusion, I expres heartiest thanks to these good people for their hos-
pitable and generous treatment of myself; and t you, Doctor, who responded so promptly to thei petition for help, their gratitude knows no bounds.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
*H. Shannon, M.D Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 19, 1888 September 20th The bringing, by the government direct from
Jacksonville, Fla., several hundred refugees to
Hendersonville, N. C, among whom there devel-
oped several cases of yellow fever, made it nec-
essary to have the avenues into Tennessee fro that locality guarded, especially as these refugee were disposed to scatter over the country at will To that end Dr. E. J. Peck was appointed on Sep-
tember 17th, State Inspector, with headquarters at

gees have come into Tennessee from North Caro-
lina since my appointment as inspector. I inclos copy of letter in answer to inquiries from Hender-
sonville, N. C. The worst trouble to be appre-
hended is, that most of the refugees at Henderson-
ville are negroes without money, and there ar agents for Tennessee railroads there now get-
ting up hands to work on new roads in this State.
I feel an effort will be made to bring the Florid negroes here, and they will be very difficult t detect, but I will use every effort to prevent it Yours of the 19th received, also the necessar blanks. I have been clothed with power to ad-
minister oath as instructed. There are doubl daily trains running here from Asheville an points east of there, and as the schedules are ar-
ranged now, it is impossible to inspect both train before they reach the State line, unless I can ge permission to go to Hot Springs on freight trains
Nos. 4(5 and 48; this would overcome the diffi-
culty. I wired Mr. C. H. Hudson, Superinten-
dent E T , V. & G. R. R, for this permission, an a few minutes ago received a telegram granting it."

Board of Health has ordered stopping trains on
Memphis & Charleston Railroad ten miles out fo further and thorough inspection. I notified Dr.
J. K. Sanford, of Covington, about the Trou case September 21st Upoh September 20th instructions were give the State Inspectors *.o apply same regulations t refugees from Jackson, Miss., as to those from
Decatur and infected points in Florida Newport—Inspector Peck: "Three refugees from
Gainesville, Fla , left there August 11th, and hav been at Alexander, N. O, since August 17th; ha heiltli certificates; none of them sick. Their des-
tination is Terre Haute, Ind , via Knoxville and
Jellieo; held through limited tickets; names,
Philip Miller, male, white, age 37; Mrs. Philip
Miller, white, age 25, and Mrs. A. G. Austin,
white, age 46. I learned from a passenger on th train last night from Hendersonville, N. C, tha of the eight cases of yellow fever among the refu-
gees at that place, two will probably be discharge to-morrow; five are doing well, and one will die Two cases were re|>orted in Asheville yesterday,
but it lacks confirmation. I will notify all th emigrant agents I meet that if they bring thos refugee negroes into this State they will lay them-
selves liable to arrest and punishment."
Cleveland—Ins|>ector Brown : ' On Dalton train,
12:06 p. ra , was Eliza Steven", from Tallahasse,
Fla., which place she left on September 17th for
Washington, D. C ; had certificate from Leon
County B>ard of Health, as also from U. S. officer Mrs. E. K Hollinger, age 30, with infant and nurse
(Mary Clark, colored), from the same city as Miss
Stevens; destination the same, and certificate from same authorities. On the 3:50 a. m. train,
Edgar Thomas, at present from Atlanta, says h was near, but not in Gainesville, Fla., two week xmi, destination Cincinnati, Ohio. I prevailed on
Imn to go via Kuoxville instead of Chattanooga;
had no certificate. Here is his description: White,
age 30, stoutly built, weight 100, height 5 ieet 7 inches, eyes brown, hair blnck, and scarce in quan-
titv, figure stooping slightly, complexion dark,
not very well dressed, dark brown suit. I do no like his appearance and conversation. He says
Gainesville is in Hamilton county, high up in the
State, and no yellow fever exists there"
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "To-day a ca load of refugees were detained at Morganvill until some decision as to their final dispositio could be made. It was decided to let them pas through the city, as they were going direct to Cin-
cinnati, and this p. m. they passed through wit closed doors and an officer on each platform. I
sent an officer some distance up the Cincinnati
•Southern R ulroad with them to see that they di not get off within the State of Tennessee. I di not have time to procure their signatures to th blanks you sent me, as they were here only a fe minute*. Total number in the coach was fifteen,
and they were all from Jackson, Miss."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernalhy: "I have bee so much on the wing for the last two Hays I hav been unable to write you my report of inspection In tbe beginning, let me say it was not from in-
timidation as stated in the papers that refugees wer allowed to enter the State on September 20th When the train had reached State Line, I ha been all through it, and found the parties wh were to stop in Tennessee all with certificate from doctors in Decatur, the majority from State
Health Officer Cochran, that they had not bee exposed to any of the sick of Decatur, and tha they ought to be allowed to pass out. I knew m power to stop the train at State Line was absolute,
but the question came up, if I put these people of here, Limestone county, Ala., which is rigidl quarantined, would eject them and throw the back into Tennessee, and Giles county had n guard at Stale Line to keep them out. Also man of them had not money to pass through the State,
so I deemed it best, after considering the whol question, to let them pass on their health certifi-
cates, with the promise that they would not stop i the cities nor towns, but would go directly throug the Slate. Those who stopped here were sent di-
rectly to Elkmont Springs, a high and healthfu locution, and our people fear nothing from them Those stopping in the State are as follows: Fan-
nie Donnigan, white, age 56, destination Colum-
bia; J. T. Weaver, wife and son, white, ages 56,
45 and 10, destination Campbell's Station; B. E Moore, wile and two children, white, ages 40, 30,
5 and 3, destination Nashville. The Perkin family, consisting of mother and five children,
destination Pulaski, now under observation at Elk-
mont Springs; Henrietta Beford, colored, age 20,
Elkmont Springs, and Lou Bramlet, age 18, des-
tination Pulaski—sent to the country. Put off at
State Line J. N. Chestnut, from Decatur; claime he had not been in Decatur for a week (?), but pu him off any way. From Florida I found A. Perry,
wife and child, white, ages 29, 28 years and 6
months, from Monticello, Fla., destination Chi-
cago, 111.; also, Geo. V. Ott and wife, ages 59 and
30, Irom Leon county, Fla., destination Kansas
City, Mo. They had certificates signed and seale properly; issued ours. I stopped at Prospect, an there learned that a refugee train was coming. I
went back to Stale Line, and there halted it. Al on board were refugees from Decatur, numberin about 150, all of whom had taken an oath an signed an obligation from the Tennessee State
Board of Health to pass directly through the
State and not return until after the existing quar-
antine shall have been raised, except a man an wife who gave his name as Win, Allen, but th conductor said his name was Wash Miller. I tol him he must get off the train or go directl through the State. He drew his knife and de-
clared he would not do cither. I told him h could not go a step further, and he then promise to go through the State. After the train starte he denied the promise, and proposed to stop at
Nashville or Columbia, as opportunity afforded Wired Columbia officials and you at Nnshville This man should be arrested and dealt with to th fullest extent of the law. With the addition o an assistant, the trains can be better inspecte night and day, and I intend that no refugee shal come into the State unless conditions are complie with, if the train must be detained at State Lin indefinitely."
To assist the health authorities of Alabama i depopulating Decatur, the State Board of Health,
through Maj. Geddes, Division Superintendent

Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Memphi has stopped the west bound trsiins nine miles out,
and <!oes not allow them to enter the city. Ten case i>£ yellow fever reported at Decatur, Ala., an eight at Jackson, Miss , created an alarm here, re-
stiltin" in the prevention of passenger trains o the Memphis & Charleston Railroad stopping a this place. Water Valley, Miss , has quarantine against Memphis. People are fleeing from Jack-
s>n, Canton, Water Valley and Grenada, Miss. I
think the Illinois Central Railroad will be refuse permission to stop to-day. T am told that if I ru on the train any m >re I will not be allowed to re-
torn home People in this and other towns ar wild with excitement What shall I do?"
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The extremel panicky condition of our citizens has kept m chiefly occupied in assisting Dr. Thornton, Presi-
dent City Board of Health. About 3 p. m a tele-
phmie message was received at my office in m absence to the effect that a Decatur man ha bisrded the cars at Guthrie, Ky., and got off at

Office Statf. Board of Health,
Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 22, 1888 Dear Sir—The development of yellow fever at
IVcatiir, Ala., upon our Southern border, and it disposition to spread at that place, together wit the appearance of the disease at Jackson, Miss.,
on the 20th inst., gives a gravity to the situatio at this writing which health officials (State,
county, and town) must take prompt recognitio of. and bv united effort protect Tennessee agains the possibility of the plague getting a foot-hol nithin our borders. Instructions were issued to
Slate In«j>ectors upon 20th inst. to pass no one
Erom either Decatur or Jackson, unless such per-
lon was going directly through the State withou topping, and, to guard against their returning to
State before it would be prudent for them to do so Each individual is required to subscribe to th allowing oach (if a minor, then by parent o piardian):
"/ herein/ solemnly swear that I will at this tim la-ss directly through the State of Tennessee, an will not return to within the borders of said Stat until after ten days shall have elapsed from thi date, and that I will not go into any portion of Ten-
nessee lying west of Tennessee river, or into an county forming southern border of said State a far east as, and including, Bradley county, unti after the existing quarantine shall have bee raised by the State Board of Health. So help me

Sworn and subscribed before me this da of — 1888 State I'.oard of Health Inspector Similar instructions will be promptly issued to
State inspectors regarding other points, shoul yellow fever make its appearance elsewhere Now, with the active co-operation of county an town health officials and the local civil authori-
ties in general, in the prompt and rigid enforce-
ment of the order of the State Board of Healt issued upon the. 20th inst, which reads, " Allo no refugee direct from an infected point to stop in
State," no trouble it is believed can arise It i suggested that you scrutinize closely all fresh ar-
rivals in your town and county, and if there ar even good ground for suspicion, give the publi the benefit of the doubt in every case by requir-
ing such "suspects " to leave the State upon firs train. The State Board of Health stands read and willing to give you or your constituenc prompt assistance upon notice, wherever the sam shall become necessary Very respectfully yours,
J. D. Plunket,
President Newport—Inspector Peck : "No Florida refugee came into Tennessee from North Carolina yester-
day."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On the 12:05  ra. Dalton train was Mrs. Lizzie Horton, whit age 35, hair black, eyes dark, medium height,
weight 120 pounds, who left Orlando, Fla., on
Sept. 19th, for New York City. Had certificate from local Board of Health and the Mayor of Or-
lando, and baggage certificate from U. S. officer at
Waycro*s, Ga. The 3:50 train missed souther connection. Considerable excitement and appre-
hension prevails in Cleveland because of the re-
ported spreading of the epidemic in the States ad-
joining Florida."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "Circulars wil be scattered broadcast over the country to notif the'people that Chattanooga has quarantined; ev-
ery train entering the city will be placarded Thi afternoon the Board of Health held another meet-
ing and decided not to allow the Memphis &
Charleston Railroad to run any more trains int the city. The trains on this road will make trans-
fers at Lookout, just this side of Waubatchie Trains on the Alabama Great Southern Railroa will pass around the city on the Belt Railroa without stopping. Every passenger entering th city must hereafter present a health certificate No doubt more stringent measures will be adopte to-morrow, for the excitement here is intense. To-
night the Memphis & Charleston Railroad train

that usually leaves here at 7 o'clock did not go,
and my inspectors could not meet the Nashvill and Memphis trains due here at 9:50 p. m. Wit two officers I got in a carriage and rode to Craven's,
where we held the trains until we had made  thorough inspection. We found no refugees on the
Nashville train, but on the Memphis & Charlesto train the following parties were found: N. A Bost, age 25, destination Slatesville, N. C. H had not been in Decatur for the past twelve days.
J. Leipheimer, age 22, destination Sharon, Tenn.;
his wife accompanied him, and they left Decatu two weeks ago, having been in Trinity, Ala., in th meantime. As these parties had exceeded the te days' limit, I did not have them sign the obliga-
tion."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "There were n refugees on trains to-day coming into and throug this State from Decatur, Ala., Jacksonville, Fla.,
nor Jackson, Miss. The quarantine of Limeston county, Ala., in very effective. The souther boundary of this county is the Tennessee river, an the county has placed guards at every point wher there is a crossing, and have taken charge of th ferries and will allow no one to cross at all. S there is but one outlet, and that is the Louisvill and Nashville Railroad. The bridge over the
Tennessee river is heavily guarded, and if refu-
gees do not get on at points below Decatur, the cannot get out. If this rigid quarantine is main-
tained as it is nowenforced.no refugee will get ou of Decatur in this direction. I learn that in th last twenty-four hours sixteen cases have devel-
oped and there have been two deaths, though thi information is not positive. Should anything ver important come up, will wire yon at once."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "Since the fever ha made its appearance at Jackson, Miss., all town along the line of the Illinois Central Railroad hav quarantined against Jackson, Miss., allowing n north-bound train to stop for any purpose. Mila authorities, against my judgment and opinion,
have quarantined against all the fever infecte points, permitting no train on any road to stop i the limits of her corporation. I told them the
State Board of Health was doing everything neces-
sary to keep the fever out of Tennessee, and wit the help of local Boards would be successful Trains loaded with refugees from Jackson an other towns in Mississippi, pass on all roads go-
ing north twice a day, not being allowed to stop i the State. South of Milan no inspection can b made. Received blank oaths and will administe them without favor to all. I suggested to Supt Clarke yesterday that he run a refugee train dail for them exclusively, and to continue to run hi regular train for other passengers. Owing to quar-
antine it will be difficult to communicate with yo every day. Would be pleased to have any sugges-
tions from you on the present situation. I permi no Decatur, Ala., or Jackson, Miss., to stop in
West Tennessee or the State."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No person or bag-
gage from infected localities reported to-day b train inspectors."
September 23rd Newport—Inspector Peck: "The following i the report of Florida refugees coming into this
State from North Carolina on yesterday: Alice G Castle, female, while, age 26; M. C Castle, male,
white, age 32; Clarence M. Gordon, male, white,
age 26; Phoebe D. Gordon, female, white, nge 23;
Mrs. Addie Lumpkin, female, while, age 47; Geo.
T. Fudger, male, white, age 28; C. G. Erickson,
male, white, age 22; and G. W. Russell, male,
white, age 25. All of these parties held healt certificates signed by the Mayor of Hendersonville,
N. C, and County Physician; also endorsed by
Notary Public with seal. They also had certifi-
cates that bagitsge had been thoroughly fumi-
gated by the United States officials. They wer all going to Kentucky except two, who were goin to Minneapolis, Minn. All of them had straigh limited thkets, and would not stop in Tennessee It is impossible to go to Asheville every day an work both trains, but if you think best I can ar-
range so as to take a freight train and go every othe day. Please advise me in the event of discoverin a refugee this hide of the State line, without healt certificate; shall I send him back into North Caro-
lina'.' I will pursue this course until I hear fro you."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On the 3:50 a.
m. train was Mrs. W. Pettit and daughter, Fannie,
white, age 19, from near Ocala, Marion county,
Fla., destined for Philadelphia, Pa. Had certifi-
cates from Marion county Health Officer, and als baggage certificate from the U. S. officer at Way-
cross, Ga. On the Chattanooga train, which wa one hour and forty minutes late, was W. H. Grif-
fin, who left Lake City, Fla, on Sept. II, for Co-
lumbiana, Ala. Had certificates from local Health
Officer and one for luggage from U S.M. H. S. of-
ficer at Waycross, Ga. The coming of Mr. Grif-
fin created a sensation, due to his statement of hav-
ing been in Jacksonville, Fla. The report reache me in an exaggerated form. I investigated an found that he has not been in Jacksonville for si months. Our city is on the point of establishin local quarantine, to co-operate with State Inspect-
ors. While on the cars this evening, en route for
Rome, Ga., one of our best citizens, C. L. Hard-
wick, with his usual consideration of the publi welfare and abnegation of self, offered to provid one guard at his own expense Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "I have en-
countered no refugees since my last report. Ou city is much quieter than it was yesterday, and th feeling of uneasiness seems to have subsided. Al trains on the Alabama Great Southern Railroa have been discontinued; the mail is carrie through on a locomotive. The telegram publishe in the American this morning saying that seventy -
Bix refugees from Jackson passed through her last night is a mistake ; all of the seventy-six wer from Meridian."
Upon notice from County Board of Health of
Lincoln county, that they would suggest the nam of a physician and pay his expenses, if the State
Board of Health would commission him Inspecto and give him instructions, Dr. W. F. Cronk wa thus appoinled Slate Inspector, upon 2'-'nd Septem-
ber, with headquarters at Elora. The followin is his report for the 23rd:

Health of Lincoln county, and commissioned by
State Board of Health, I have made Elora, Tenn.,
a quarantine station—where the Hnntsville roa intersects the Winchester and Alabama road,  distance of forty-seven miles from Decatur. Fiv refugees, one of whom was very sick, passed her yesterday at 3p.ni., for Nashville. I wired Dr Mitchell, City Health Officer at that place, a once, so that he could take steps to keep them fro stopping there. I will not allow any one to enter
Lincoln county or State without a certificat laving they have not been in a yellow fever dis-
trict."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "In accordanc with your instructions I met the refugee train o last night, not at State Line, as suggested, but at
Athens, Ala., at 5 a. tu.. after having spent a sleep-
less night waiting its approach. There were abou fifty passengeri", all of whom were to pass throug the Slate, and had signed the obligations and take the oath required by the State Board of Health fo refugees to pass through the State. It is ver probable that there were two cases of yellow fever
[Dr. Taylor and Mr. Gatilt] on the last coach o the train, which was locked and no one permitte to enter. I did not go into the coach as it was un-
necessary. My people here are so panicked an terrorized that I have been threatened with quar-
antine myself. There were no refugees on this af-
ternoon's train from any infected point."
On this day another refugee train passe through Tennessee, and, in accordance with th rules of the Tennessee State Board of Health,
permitting them to enter this State for the pur-
pose of passing directly through northwardly, th following parties swore and subscribed to the fol-
lowing oath:

September 24th Newport—Inspector Peck: "The following i the report for those that came over from North
Carolina yesterday: Andy Baker, white, male,
age 20, a refugee from Jacksonville, Fla., and a he had no certificate I arrested him and sent hi back into North Carolina; John Luth, white,
male, age 21; Mrs. Maud Holmes and child, white,
female, age 26; E T. Fenin, white, male, age 37;
D. W. Hockett, white, male, age 28; destinatio of all of the above was Cincinnati, O.; A. E Wigglesworth, white, male, age 24, destination
Louisville, Ky.; John Eccles, white, male, age 28,
destination Knoxville, Tenn. Two of these partie were put off the train at this place by the conduct-
or, as they had no railroad tickets, but they hel health certificates, and money being made up fo them, they went on to-day."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On Dalton train,
3:50 a. m., was W. B McMurray, white, age 28,
height 5 feet 9 inches, weight 170. He is a nativ of Jacksonville, Fla., but has a certificate showin residence in Gadsden, Ala., the past fifteen days,
and has not been in Florida since August loth He had a certificate from the United States office at Waycross showing that his baggage had bee fumigated. His destination was Knoxville, Tenn On the 12:05 train, F. M. Newhall, white, age 40,
from Palatka, Fla., and T. H. Lyons, white, age
36, from same place, which they left on September
22nd, traveling together to New York City. Ha certificates from the Board of Health, and one fo luggage from the United States officer. Yours o the 22nd to hand. I have now the assistance o the municipal officers in the quarantine work. I
have met no Decatur, Ala., or Jackson. Miss., ref-
ugees. If you have blanks for administering oath please send me some more."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch : "I have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. The following train have been discontinued by direction of the loca authorities: The Nashville, Chattanooga it St Louis that arrives at 9:50 p. m. and departs at 5
a. m.; t'ie Cincinnati Southern that arrives at 6:40
a. m. and departs at 7:55 a. m. On the Alabama
Great Southern all trains have been discontinued Memphis Ai Charleston trains only run betwee here and Stevenson, Ala. The East Tennessee,
Virginia & Georgia, Western & Atlantic and Chat-
tanooga, Rome A Columbus Railroads run al trains as usual. Trains on all roads p issing Wau-
hntchie are to be stopped and held there until pas-
sengers and baggage are inspected. Passenger will be compelled to procure health certificate from the agent at the depot from which they start:
this applies to all railroads entering the city. The
Western it Atlantic, East Tennessee, Virginia &
Georgia and Cincinnati Southern Railroads wil be treated in a like manner. Should a passenge from an infected point be found on any train, th whole train, passengers and all, will not be allowe to enter the city."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy : " I failed to fin any refugees from Decatur, Ala., Jackson, Miss.,
or Jacksonville, Fla., to-day. From Pensacola,
Fla., I found John Crosgrove, white, age 41; ha certificate from Mayor Chipley; issued him ours"
His destination was Cincinnati, O. I failed to re-
port the names, on the 22nd, of A. N. Nichols an wife, white, ages 33 and 31, from Bradford county,
Fla., destination Chicago, III. They had correc certificates; issued ours to them. I inspect th trains now in regard to points south of Decatu for the reason that a great many refugees have fle into Cullman, HarUelle and other points below
Decatur, and they might attempt to come into
Tennessee before ten days have elapsed since thei departure from Decatur, and in this way migh bring yellow fever into our State. I question th conductor upon all these points, and if I find  passenger from there I make him establish his cit-
izenship there, or that he has not been in Decatu in ten days past. This is applied to those wh have tickets to stop in the State Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "But fe passengers going west or south. The excitemen is unabated even in Memphis, as well as in the sur-
rounding towns. Many believe the fever exists in
Memphis. The railroads need not expect a modi-
fication of the present quarantine so long as th trains pass through the infected districts. Report from Jackson and Decatur not so alarming lo-dav,
but none can tell what a day may bring forth This point is well guarded."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "The North-boun trains on the Illinois Central Railroad, wit very few refugees from Jackson, Mississippi,
pass through Tennessee every day, but are no allowed by local authorities to stop at stations,
to put oft'or to take on any person whatever. Th whole country is panic-stricken and has quaran-
tined against everybo.ly and everything from the
South. I am daily threatened with quarantineb the towns along the line of the Illinois Central
Railroad for inspecting trains. Not being allowe to get off or on at Milan and other places, m daily movements are, to a considerable extent,
hampered. Only one mail out from here since last
Thursday. No north-bound trains on the Mobile
& Onto Railroad are allowed to stop at Corinth,
Miss., to put oft' or to take on passengers or freight No trains on the Louisville & Nashville Railroa go nearer than ten miles of Memphis Travel o the road, in consequence, is very light. I am do-
ing the best I can under the circumstances, an will continue as long as the Board desire."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No suspicious per-
son or baggage have been reported to me to da by train inspectors. The party from Jackson,
Miss., alluded to in yesterday's report, went to St Louis, after a thorough disinfection of clothin and baggage. Several arrests have been made to-
day (by the city inspectors) of parties arrivin here since noon Saturday. None have proven t be from infected points. Since noon of the 22nd,
no one has been allowed by the local authuitie to come into this city from the east side of th river. At noon on the 25th the same rule wil apply to the west side." a
September 25th Newport—Inspector Peck: "For to-day I hav to report the following: II. C. Barr, white, male,
age 44, and his six children; M. A. Foucht, while,

Tenn."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On the 12:05 p.
m. train I found Wm P McMahon, white, age 47,
and his nephew J. G. Miller, age 23. They left
St. Augustine, Fla., on September 12th, and hav been staying in Atlanta, Ga. They have certifi-
cates from the Atlanta" authorities; destination
Pottsville, Pa. On the same train I found D. L Whitniore, white, age 37, from Tallahassee, Fla.,
which place he left on September 23d, bound for
Philadelphia, Pa.; had certificate from Leon
County Board of Health, and also U. S. M. H.S.
certificate for luggage. On the 3:50 a. m. trai there was no passengers from the infected points,
mostly from Atlanta and other points in Georgia Flagman Riggs, who runs into Selma, Ala., ever third day, informs me that the people of that plac suspect that yellow fever exists in the town of
Cullman, Ala., fifteen miles from Selma. I giv his report, not knowing whether it be true o otherwise. I shall keep the entire State of Ala-
bama in view, as liable to be an infected sectio oi country."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Attached t the sleeper to-day was a car with five persons i it, claiming to come from Pensacola, viz.: B. O Heath, white, age 27; Minnie Heath, white, age
21 ; J. T. Heath, white, age 38, and two smal children of B. O. Heath, ages 2 and 3 years. The claimed to have come from Pensacola, Fla., bu swore that they came from Argyle, Fla, and the wanted to go to Memphis Tenn. As they wer evidently refugees, and there was some doubt a to where they came from, I administered to the our oath not to stop in the State, and took a de-
scription of them, which I enclose. Telegram i regard to passengers from Cullman and Flint re-
ceived ; will ohey instructions, in fact have alread inspected trains with reference to these points Inspector Whitson will run down to Athens ever night and come back on the 2:30 train, that h may have plenty of time to inspect the train an not have to detain it. With his assistance, n refugee can escape us"
Grand Junction —Inspector Prewitt: "Passe refugees west to-day, by dirt road going to Arkan-
sas; they were all l ight. We are to meet Capt Mann, Superintendent of the Illinois Central Rail-
road, this evening, to confer with him. Excite-
ment abating a little; no trains allowed to stop,
however."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "All trains on the
Mobile & Ohio Railroad discontinued. All loca trains on the Illinois Central have stopped; onl through trains now run."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors have not reported to me to-day any person o baggage from infected districts. The number o health certificates applied for by parties leavin the city has greatly decreased. There seems to b a marked improvement in the state of public feel-
ing as to our danger."
September 26th Newport—Inspector Peck: "The following i the report of yesterday: H. Sheldon, white, male,
age 22, walked from Hendersonville, N. C, t thi» place—he is a Florida refugee from Jackson-
ville—had no health certificate, so I arrested hi and sent him back into North Carolina; Andy
Baker, white, male, age 20, destination Cincinnati,
Ohio; William Hearn, white, male, age 29; Ellen
Hearn, white, female, age 27; J. H Davis, white,

Gainesville, Fla., which place they left for At-
lanta over three weeks ago. Certificate from
Alachua County Health Officer, also certificat from Atlanta showing that they sojourned in tha city for twenty days. Present destination, New
York City; final, Montreal, Canada. Inspector
DeArmond found a man at depot who claimed t have left Pensacola on August 12th, but unde cross-examination he admitted that he had bee in Tampa on September 1st; said he had trampe here from Dalton; was badly frightened whe threatened with heavy fine; begged permission t leave the State on next train. This he was per-
mitted todo; name, E.J. Sadler, white, age 27,ligh hair, blue eyes, fair complexion, medium height;
altogether a rather suspicious character."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "1 found from
Pensacola, Fla., to-day J. W. Babcock, white, age
57; destination Bay City, Mass. He had a cer-
tificate. I put off at State Line El Crocket and
Minnie Crockett, ages 32 and 21, while, wh claimed to have gotten on at King's Station. A they could show no evidence of their residence,
and wanted to stop in Nashville, I thought bes to put them off. I learned from a passenger after-
wards that they got on between Flint and Decatur From Flint, Ala., Geo. B. Gatlen, destination Al-
bany, N. Y.; H. L. Hunt, destination Boston,
Mass.; Jim Sanders, destination Bowling Green,
Ky.;OoraE Hunt, destination Boston, Mass Al took the oath, and I passed them on. When I
put Crockett and wife off at State Line, the car had stopped on the Alabama side of the line The guards came out in full force, and made th refugees get back on the cars, threatening deat to the conductor and engineer if they left the ref-
ugees there, I let refugees get on, and stop within
Tennessee line and put them off there. Here is  conflict between States How shall it be rem-
edied? These guards will not allow refugees t stop here, and in order to put them off, cars wil have to stop in Tennessee."
Pulaski—Inspector Whitson: "I met No. 4
train this morning from Montgomery, at Athens,
Ala.; found no refugees from Florida; found
Mrs. Anna M. Rice, age 35; Miss Huttie Rio-, age
17, and three small children, from Moss Point,

zens, quarantine was again resumed by the loca authorities on all trains on both roads, Memphis
& Charleston and Illinois Central Railroads, there-
by showing the necessity of the general govern-
ment taking charge of the matter in conjunc-
tion with State Boards of Health."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees from
Jackson, Miss, have passed on any of the train since last report. Refugees from other towns in
Mississippi pass every day, going through our
State. Under present local quarantine and non-
intercourse regulations, it is a difficult matter fo any person to gel off of trains at all. Great ex-
citement at Memphis. A suspicious case re-
ported."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Nothing suspi-
cious reported to me to-day by train inspectors The suspicious case (Binford) would never hav created alarm but for the panicky condition of th public mind here; nor would it have been classe suspicious by the Board of Health, had the ma not been thought to have been at Decatur since it infection."

rect from Mobile, en route to New York. Several
Florida refugees are writing to this city for boar rates, but as their non-exposure appears to be  matter of uncertainty, they were not given muc encouragement."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "I enclose yo the blanks filled nut by a party of refugets from
Camp Perry, who were detained at Citico to-day They came in on the East Tennessee, Virginia &
Georgia Railroad, and, after remaining at Citic until 6:20 p. m , departed for their several desti-
nations via the Cincinnati Southern Railroad."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "On to-day' trains I found Mrs. W. R. Brown, white, age 36;
daughter, age 14, from Hanceville, Ala.; also,
from same place, Mrs. T. H. Harbert and tw children, ages 30, 12 and 10, and also T. H. Har-
bert, age 34, and W. M. Brown. These people ha refugeed from Decatur, from yellow fever, to Cull-
man. When the first case appeared there they fled to
Hanceville, and to-day were on their way to Nash-
ville. They were out from Decatur several days,
but I thought it best to have them go through the
State, so I administered the oath, which I enclose Tom Card well, at Prospect, whose case was reporte to you by telegraph upon the 26th inst., is bette to-day. Has had no fever all day, and his phys-
icians pronounce his case now malarial fever."

4 at Athens, Ala., this morning; found no refu-
gees from Florida or infected points in Mississipp or Alabama. The case of Mr. Tom Cardwell, at
Prospect, Tenn., being a suspicious case. I tel-
egraphed Mr. Bradley, train dispatcher at Nash-
ville, to give No. 4 orders not to stop at Prospect
As no such orders were given No. 4, it stopped b signal I found it had stopped for passengers, but
I did not allow any one to board the train. I
had heard previous to leaving Pulaski that  young lady, a cousin of Mr. Tom Cardwell. wa stopping at his home, and intended to take No. 4
for Nashville, and as there were several ladies a the depot, I judge she was one of the party."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: No refugees from
Jackson, Miss., or other fever infected points hav passed since last report. The panic is subsiding,
and reason and common souse are coming to th front at last."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The only admis-
sions into the city reported by the train inspector to-day have been parties allowed to enter by orde of the local Board of Health. No person or baggag being from infected localities, I take pleasure i reporting that the non-intercourse quarantine her has been raised, the former system of inspectio service being revived with special reference to in-
fected localities, thus relegating the health servic to the State Board of Health, where it properl belongs."

rying it in my clothing while inspecting refugee on trains, hence I take the precaution of fumigat-

Elora—Inspector Cruuk: "I have nothing t report of any interest. I have put off several ref-
ugees from Decatur and sent them back into Ala-
bama. I had the man Cochran, heretofore re-
ported by me, put over in Jackson county,
Alabama. I went down to Huntsville, Ala, to-da to investigate that case of yellow fever. I met
Drs. Dement, Lowery, Baldridge and Erskine They assured me ihey did not have any fears o its spreading there. I put off a brakeman here  day or so ago who had been running on the Mem-
phis <ft Charleston road, and sent him to Steven-
son, Ala. There are several refugees in this sec-
tion, hiding out from us. We have tried to cap-
ture them, but up to this writing have failed to d so. What do you think of quarantining against
Hnntsville? Dr. Lowery, Health Officer at tha place, informed me to-day that he would not issu any health certificates now since the developmen of tbe case of yellow fever there."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "On to-day' trains I found W. W. Bloodworth, age 30, while,
from Pensacola, Fla.; destination Louisville, Ky He had certificate and I issued ours. Also, from
Vicksburg, Miss.,W. K. McLaurine, white, age 31,
destination Cincinnati, O. No refugees from in-
fected points. Travel very light. There is n longer need of an assistant, consequently wire you to-day from Athens. The excitement is sub-
siding all along the line. Athens hag taken of her guards, except at trains; Pulaski has don likewise. The cool weather has brought a feelin of security."
Pulaski—Inspector Whitson: " I found only tw suspicious persons on the train last night, namely:
J P. Feeney, white, age 24, destination Mt. Ver-
non, 111.; C. Worthinglon, white, age 29, destina-
tion Guthrie, Ky. I took their oaths and passe them through the State."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Excite-
ment abating; refugees returning home. Sobe reason, I trust, will soon be restored. Dr. Bigg and myself tried to stem the current, but to no pur-
pose. Much of this hasty action, I have no doubt,
appears ridiculous to the outside world, and I fo one regret to see it. The quarantine was workin well, and as evidence of it, no cases have devel-
oped of significance or consequence anywhere i this State. I think the restrictions Here will b removed October 1st."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors report nothing from infected localities to-day Travel is still light, nor will it probably increas much until Monday."
September 29th At noon upon this day the following genera order was issued, thereby removing the necessit for the services of Inspectors Brown at Cleveland,

tificates from points in Mississippi not infected,

After the quarantine had been raised, as per or-
der of September 2'Jtb, William McKinley, a ref-
ugee from Decatur, Ala., came down from Louis-
ville, Ky., to his home in Murfreesboro sick. I proved to lie a case of yellow fever, the only cas which developed in Tennessee during the summer The following are the official reports of the loca health authorities concerning it:
Murfreesboro—Dr. R. S. Wendel, Health Offi-
cer of Rutherford county: ''I write to report  death here of yellow fever to-day. The subjec was a resident of this place, but had been in De-
catur, Ala., since Sept. 1st. He came home her aboutSept. 20th, and I gave him orders to remai closely at home for two weeks at least. Instead o that he went to Louisville, Ky., the next day, an returned here on the 2',lth sick. Dr. Murfree sa him next day and was suspicious of the case, an required the whole family to remain at home. I
visited the patient on Monday with Dr. M. an was fearful it was yellow fever, but very loth t believe it. The dwelling and bedding is being dis-
infected, and the family will remain isolated fo some days. The weather now being so cool, w hope to have no more cases. If anything more i necessary please inform me. The remains will b buried this evening. No excitement in town'
though some uneasiness."
Murfreesboro—Dr. J. B. Murfree, President City
Board of Health: "I have to report a case of yel-
low fever occurring in a refugee from Decatur,
Ala. Mr. Will. McKinley, whose parents live i this city, about 17 years old, was engaged in busi-
ness at Decatur, Ala., when the yellow fever epi-
demic began there. He left Decatur on the 19t of Sept. with quite a number of others who wer fleeing from the pestilence. He came to Murfrees-
boro but only remained a few hours and then wen on to Louisville, where he remained till last Sat-
urday, the 29th ult., when he left that place for
Murfreesboro. He arrived here last Saturda night at 9:30 p. m., and went directly to bed. H was seen by me on Sunday evening at 6 o'clock,
when he presented the premonitory symptoms o yellow fever. Our local Board of Health wa promptly notified of his presence in our midst an of his illness. The Board of Health took decide steps to isolate the case and his family. '< he en-
tire family were required to remain in the house,
and no one allowed to enter it from the outside Yesterday morning he presented unmistakabl symptoms of yellow fever. His condition continu-
ally grew worse, and he died to day at 1 o'cloc p. m. He will be quietly buried this afternoon,
the house thoroughly fumigated, and the famil will be kept isolated for the next two weeks."
Subsequently, upon October 10th, the followin additional particulars were received, detailing th steps taken after the death occurred Murfreesboro—Dr. J. B. Murfree, President
City Board of Health: "Your communication o the 8th inst. addres-ed to Dr. R S Wendel,
County Health Otlicer, has been referred by hi to me for answer. In reply I would state tha the dwelling has been disinfected both inside an out. On the inside the carpet was taken up an the floor thoroughly scoured, and every day sinc the death of the patient carbolic acid has bee sprinkled over the floor and walls, and open ves-
sels containing chloride of lime have been place in different parts of the room, and sulphur ha been burnt with the doors and windows closed Lime in profusion has been thrown all around th house. The bedding used by the patient was a once removed out of the house and burned, excep the mattress, which (it being entirely covered b a feather bed), was disinfected by sulphur an carbolic acid. The furniture of the room ha been subjected to the fumes of sulphur and th chloride of lime, and thoroughly sprinkled wit carbolic acid. The patient brought with hi neither trunk or valise. He left his trunk an clothing in Decatur. On his arrival home Satur-
day night he removed his underwear, which wa washed the following Monday. He was buried i the suit of clothes he wore home. All his othe clothes, with his overcoat, were burned. Hi father and mother nursed him, and after his death

their clothes were also burned. The dejection from the time of their being suspicions of yello fever, were carefully deposited in a hole in th ground, dug for the purpose, and immediately cov-
ered with dry dirt. His body was bathed in car-
bolic acid and his burial clothes sprinkled wit it. No disinfectant was placed in the coffin. Th disinfection was done by my direction, and ex-
ecuted by Dr. J. S. Smilii, colored, and Mr. John
Davis, both of whom had had yellow fever. None o the family went to the cemetery with the remains,
and only a few friends, barely sufficient to bur him. The hearse was preceded by a detachmen of police, who warned every one off the street and caused all the doors and windows of th houses passed to be closed. The family are stil quarantined, and will be for some days yet October 5tii Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "No refugee have been reported to me to-day."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The nearest ap-
proach to a suspect reported to-day was a passen-
ger on the Mississippi A Tennessee Railroad, re-
ported by Inspector Mahon. Said j as-enger wa a Mr. E. E. Brougher, with health certificat signed by Dr. Wirt Johnston, of Jackson, Miss.,
dated September 20th, and stating that Mr Brougher had not been wiiliin one mile of an infection of yellow fever. Mr. Brougher state that he fled to the country in the vicinity of the
State Insane Asylum, four or five miles from
Jackson. The certificate of Dr. Johnston was en-
dorsed on the 4th inst., by Dr. T. J. Mitchell, i charge of the asylum. Mr. Brougher was e route to Clarksdale, Miss., and 1 approved his cer-
tificate. He waited al depot half an hour fo train, and left for destination."

and the demand for health certificates is conse-
quently large."

terest reporled to me to-day. The number of ap-
plicants for health certificates has greatly dimin-
ished, and most likely none will be sought in  day or two, if there is no further development o fever at Jackson, Miss."

we have not had a case of yellow fever withi the borders of our State, and that only after quar-
antine had been raised."

K.ET'OE.T FOE SEPTEMBEB. 1888 The only notable features of the month of
September were the low temperature whic prevailed during the last few days, resultin in frosts, and the unusual rainfalls, occurrin on the (ith, 15th and 22d.

.SUBSCRIPTION, 250 PER ANNUM Entered at PostofBce at Nashville as Second Class Matter The Natural History of Health Resorts The origin of health resorts is generall involved in obscurity, the difficulty of in-
vestigating it being that they are no made. They are not bom like the poet;
they simply grow like Topsy So far, however, as it can be traced,
we desire here to ascertain some facts i regard to their physiology with a view t elucidating their pathology. To drop th figurative, we desire to ascertain how it i that health resorts at certain stages o their existence become resorts of sick-
ness, and how, if not then abandoned,
they can again become salubrious Such resorts generally begin somethin after this manner: The head of a fam-
ily finds that his city residence during th heat of summer has become incompatibl with the healtb, strength or comfort o his household. The family begins to
. 4.
dream of fresh breezes, green foliage,
and crystal springs; children are puny,
wife is weary, and, in short, somethin must be done. He hears of some cottag or farm-house in the country which is fo rent or at which boarding can be had. I is situated on a breezy hill, with abund-
ant shade trees adjoining, and an unfailin spring of pure, cool water about halfwa down the hill. His fancy is caught, an he moves out with his family to the im-
mense improvement of health, tempe and happiness in general Being well pleased, he buys the place,
and invites an intimate friend to sta with him the next season. Friend so wel pleased that he proposes to board hi family with him, and, as there is not roo for all, brings a tent for them to lodg in. Eesult still excellent. Friend pro-
poses to buy or lease a small lot an build a cottage upon it, and the first set-
tler begins to see that by selling or leas-
ing lots he can get his summer residenc for nothing, and a little community, hal encampment, half village, grows u around the original settlement Additional land is now taken up an additional sales and leases increase th value and attraction by the resulting in-
crease of population, and by this time  definite character is impressed ou the set-
tlement. In one case, if the prevailin character is serious and moral, a lecture-
room and chapel is built; in the other,
where pleasure is the leading pursuit^
a ball-room, drinking saloons, gambling

booths aud we have a summer resort,
full blast But by degrees it is found that th spring does not hold out sufficiently to ac-
commodate the increasing numbers, an its water is not as healthy as it was The soil, in fact, around it has becom saturated with the filth, offal, garbag which will accumulate where a numerou population is closely assembled, and peo-
ple begin sending to more distant spring at much inconvenience and without get-
ting the best sort of water Presently an epidemic of typhoid o scarlet fever, diphtheria, or malaria i some form breaks out, and a stamped results. The health resort become empty for that season This is a crisis in its career. One o two results has now to arrive: First, th place may be abandoned with considera-
ble loss to the original proprietor and th smaller purchasers and leaseholder of cottages; but, secondly, these peopl conclude that they cannot afford such  loss, and a meeting is held and (perhapS but not very likely) a professed sani-
tarian is consulted. For one thing,  new water supply is effected by wate conveyed from a distant spring, wel tested as to its quality, and an arrange-
ment is made for carting away filth an garbage every morning, and these ar-
rangements being extensively advertised,
population begins to return But with some improvements, th health is not such as it was in the inno-
cent infancy of the settlement. Th diurnal scavenger is inadequate; noxiou refuse accumulates in the cottages (whic are small and close together) waiting fo the scavenger; and, after another epi-
demic, it is found that some system o sewerage more efficient than the ox car with open barrels of abominations is de-
manded. Moreover, it becomes eviden that the whole settlement is badl planned, or, rather, has never bee planned at all; that the cottages are to close together; that they obstruct on another in regard to ventilation an drainage; in other words, the proprietor have a city on their hands with only th sanitary arrangements of a small encamp-
ment.
ANOTHER CRISIS And this time it requires enlightene enterprise and some courage to face it Ill-placed and crowded cottages must b removed, and in this way streets must b widened and straightened, and, above all,
a sewerage system commensurate wit the water supply already established But this, as has been said, requires a amount of enterprise and courage no always to be expected among the origina proprietors If somebody does not do it, the life o the health resort is again threatened, an a result under these circumstances ha more than once happened as follows:
The rent and purchase of cottages ha declined; the annual assemblage of com-
pany has fallen off, and the income ha become smaller and smaller, till it is n longer a paying investment; the whol thing is sold out for an old song; som long-headed capitalist becomes the pur-
chaser, remodels the whole on thoroug sanitary principles, and a first-class sum-
mer resort of permanent value results Typhoid Fever The number of localities reporting the ex-
istence of typhoid fever each month in Ten-
nessee demands of the local health authoritie immediate and careful investigation. No wate or soil contamination, no typhoid fever, is th axiomotic teaching of sanitary science, an consequently no weary weeks of suffering an prostration, no long nights of anxious watch-
ing by friends, and no untimely deaths, where-
as hundreds are now annually consigned t premature graves by this preventable scourge.

"No report. t Estimated Innoculation for Cholera At the meeting of the Academy of Sciences of
Aug. 20, M. Pasteur road a communication for
Dr. Gamaleia, of Odessa, in which the author give an account of the procedure he had adopted, whic is similar to that practiced by M. Pasteur for hy-
drophobia. Dr. Gamaleia had studied M. Pasteur' method in Paris, and his experiments with th choleraic virus upon animals have, according t him, proved successful. Dr. Gamaleia's metho is based on his discovery that pigeons inuoculate with the blood of guinea pigs which have been in-
noculated with cholera virus die from "dry chol-
era," with detachment of the intestinal epithelium That which is still more important is that the mi-
crobe appears also iu the blood of the pigeon which had succumbed. When the virus has thu passed through the pigeon it acquires such inten-
sity that one or two drops will kill pigeons in fro eight to twelve hours, and even destroy guine pigs. But when a pigeon was innoculated wit the uncultured virus it became refractory to th cultivated virus of the highest intensity of viru-
lence. If the culture-broth be heated to 120° C.
for twenty minutes, to destroy with certainty al the microbes which it contains, it is observed tha the heating had left in the sterilized culture a ver active toxic substance, which determines the char-
acteristic phenomena iu the animals experimente on. Dr. Gamaleia has expressed his readiness t repeat the experiments at Paris, in the presence o'
a committee of the Academy of Sciences, and t try on himself a sufficient dose for human inocu-
lation. M. Pasteur readily accepted the offer,
and it has been arranged that the experiment should be carried on in his laboratory in Novem-
ber.—Paris correspondent Medical Record All Should be Vaccinated
Vaccination's power of protection against small-
pox is effectually shown by the recently publishe statistics of the German Empire, iu which the prac-
tice of vaccination and revaccination is compulsory For the year 1886 the small-pox death rate for th whole empire was only .03 to each 100,000 of th population. In the larger cities it ranged from .07
in Berlin to 3.6 in Hamburg. Compared with the
German cities, the rates in other European citie where the practice is not compulsory, the deat rates from small pox ranged from .06 in Loudon to-
4.9 in Liverpool; Paris 9.0; Brussels 11.4; St. Pe-
tersburg 15.3; Moscow 34.1; Vienna 26.2; Venice
51.6; Rome 134.3; Genoa 153.8; Festh 368.7; Mar-
seilles 545.3 to the 100.000 of population. Mor than two-thirds of the deaths from small-pox in
Germany were in cities like Hamburg, which hav a large foreign shipping trade, and in those dis-
tricts which lie immediately along the Russian and
Austrian borders.—Sanitarian.

House-Sweepings and Consumption Cornet has experimented with the dust ob-
tained from the walls and floors of various dwell-
ings in which tuberculous patients had been; in-
noculating guinea pigs with it, and carefull excluding all possibility of infection from outsid sources. In this way twenty-one rooms of seven
Berlin hospitals were examined, and bacilli foun to have been present in the dust from most o them. Positive results were also obtained wit the dnst from insane asylums and penitentiaries The dwellings of fifty-three tubercular patient were investigated in the same way, and the dus in the neighborhood of twenty patients found t be virulent. It was the case with absolute regu-
larity that the dust was always virulent when th patient had been in the habit of spitting on th floor or in a handkerchief, while it was never s when a spit cup had been employed.—Munchener
Medicinische IVochenschrift, 1888, No. 308 Tornadoes - How to Escape Them The following valuable suggestions ar extracted from a little manual entitled,
"Tornadoes: What They Are, and How to
Escape Them," just issued by John P Finley, Lieutenant Signal Corps, United
States Army:
PROTECTION TO HUMAN LIFE The successful accomplishment of this objec depends upon the position and surroundings o the observer on the approach of the tornado, th character of motion possessed by the tornad cloud at the time, the width of the path of th storm, and the velocity with which it is moving The following precautions, which have been de-
termined upon as the result of careful investiga-
tion, observation and experience, are arranged i short paragraphs for easy reference and read memorizing If these rules and suggestions are strictly com-
plied with, they can be depended upon as furnish-
ing practical means for securing ample protectio to life and limb.
1. The south side is the dangerous portion of  tornado; the north side is the safe portion,
2. In the open country never undertake to es-
cape from a tornado cloud, without first makin sure of the points of trie compass, and that th direction which you propose to take is a lino a right angles to the path of the advancing cloud.
3. If the cloud is moving to the northeast, the the line of escape is to the northwest; if to th east, then to the north. Stand facing the advan-
cing cloud in the direct line of its approach, an the safe side ix always to tlie right.
4. To make escape certain, the tornado clou should be about throe-fourths of a mile distant This gives the observer a momentary chance t ascertain the character of motion it possesses, th velocity of progression, the w idth of the path, an the points of the compass These estimates must of necessity be approxi-
mate, but can be made sufficiently accurate to b depended upon. At a greater distance than three-
fourths of a mile it would be difficult, in mos cases, for the observer to obtain this informatio with any degree of satisfaction, unless the atmos-
phere was clear and the cloud advancing over th open prairie. It is presumed in this case, of course,
that the observer has been watching the approac of the tornado for some time. There is alway sufficient warning of the approach of these storms,
and plenty of time to prepare for them if the warn-
ings are heeded But there are always people who will persist i postponing action until it is too late to receive an benefit from it.
5. Make every effort to retain command of al of your senses on the upproach of a tornado, be-
cause your safety largely depends upon acting ju-
diciously, as well as correctly and quickly.
G. When trying to escape from a tornado neve run to the northeast, e<t.it or southeast.
7. If the tornado cloud is possessed of the oscil-
latory motion, swaying from side to side of th central line of cloud movement, the greatest car must be exercised in trying to make one's escape However much the cloud may depart from its gen-
eral direction of progression, it will eventuall come back to that direction further on its course,
so that when the entire truck is projected upon  chart it will be seen that the general direction ha been preserved, no matter what the departure ma have been at any time. If the cloud is zigzagging,
wait until it has recrosseil the track to the south,
and then move quickly to the north or northwest.
8. Never take refuge in a forest, a clump of trees,
or near any object that may be overturned by th wind. Your chance of escape from any injury i very much greater in the open field, where you ca watch the cloud and tuke the proper action at th right time.
9. Suppose the tornado cloud to be distant fro the observer one hundred and sixty rods and it progressive velocity (the average) forty-four mile per hour, it would then follow that one mile i passed in eighty-two seconds, and one hundre and sixty rods in forty-one seconds. Assumin the average width of the tornado's track to b eighty rods and the position of the observer at th center of that path watching the advancing cloud,
it will be seen that he has about forty-oue second in which to run a distance of about as many rods It is apparent from this calculation, which is base upon average results and rather underestimated,
that the observer must act quickly and intelli-
gently.
10. A frame building is safer than one built o brick or stone. The former is more elastic an holds together longer. The latter goes down i the first crash, anil the debris is whirled into  heap in the center of the foundation. This is es-
pecially the case where a brick or stone buildin stands alone. In a block of such buildings on structure supports another, and there is not quit so much danger of entire destruction In any event, however, the brick or stone build-
ing is the most dangerous, because it so readil crumbles and separates into falling masses tha the inmates are never safe from injury.
11. In a frame structure the safest place is i the cellar; but in a brick or stone structure it i the most dangerous. In the former case if th building is destroyed it is invariably carried awa from the foundation. In the latter case the cella is filled with debris.
12. The safest building to construct is one made

STATE BO ABB OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
entirely of wood, with a " barn frame," and not t exceed one story and a half in height. Wher several buildings are connected together in a row,
the height may be increased one or more storie with safety.
13. No structure that rises above the surface o the earth, however made, can resist the violenc of a tornado, and therefore no building is safe a property, or as a resort to protect life.
14. Under no circumstances, whether in a build-
ing or a cellar, ever take a position in a northeas room, in a northeast corner, in an cast room, o against an east wall. Remember that the stor always approaches from the west and passes to th east, thus carrying all debris away from the wes wall.
15. If the observer's position, regarding the tor-
nado cloud, is such that he cannot escape from it fury by running in the proper direction, then h should throw himself prone (face downward) upo the ground, head to the east and arms placed ove the head to protect it. Never remain standin and attempt to weather the storm; it would prob-
ably cost you your life If one chances to be near a large stone or stump,
or some heavy object low down and firmly imbed-
ded in the ground, take a position directly to th cast of it, lying prone upon the earth, head towar the object, protecting the former with folded arms This advice is to be followed only in case of a emergency, when other and better opportunitie have been forfeited.
16. It is better, if possible, never to take refug near any object located within the center of th storm's path, especially not a tree or any objec that rises some distance above the surface of th ground.
17. If compelled to remain in a building not pro-
vided with a cellar, take a position on the first
(ground) floor Go to the west room, stand nea the center of it, and await the storm. It it appear that the building will be entirely destroyed, then i ia possible that the debris will be carried over an beyond you. It it is evident that only a portio of the house will be destroyed, then seek safety i the east room, standing near the center of it. for i is this portion of the house that will remain in cas of partial destruction Under any circumstances it is extremely perilou to remain in a house if it stands in the path of th tornado. Life and limb are in constant danger,
and there is nothing like safety to be secured The Climate of Nashville By L. X. Jbsunokskv, Serg't Signal Corps Located in latitude 30 deg. and 10 min. nort and SO deg. and 47 min. west, with an elevatio of 549 feet above mean tide, Mobile Bay, Nash-
villians enjoy a climate distinctly their own, dif-
fering in many respects from that of our siste cities—Knoxville, Chattanooga and Memphis. O the four, Kuoxville's mean annual temperature is
2 deg. lower; Chattanooga's 2 deg. higher, and tha of Memphis 3 deg. higher than that of Nashville The conditions of atmosphere, pressure and hu-
midity differ also. The barometer always stand higher in the eastern than in the western and cen-
tral portions of the State, the air being "banke up," as it might be called, in the mountainous re-
gions of Knoxville and Chattanooga. The percent-
age of relative humidity of the air is the greates at Memphis. Onr highest atmospheric pressur occurs in November, and the lowest in June or
July. The mean annual temperature at Nashvill is 59.6°, and for the seasons—spring 59.3°, sum-
mer 78.4°, autumn 59.7°, winter 41c January i our coldest month and July our warmest. It oc-
casionally happens that the hot waves extend fa into August, producing higher temperatures tha in July. This was the case in August, 1874, in
1881, and dnring the first two weeks of August,
1888. The extremes in temperature at Nash-
ville during the past twenty years were from 104'
in August, 1874, to 10° below zero in January,
1884, making the extreme range 114c. The ver low temperature of 7C below zero during the firs week in February, 1880. was the most severe ex-
perienced in thirty-two years The occurrence of the first and last frosts hav also a great bearing on the climate and produc-
tions of this locality, in that it is one of the great-
est interest and value in that respect to the florist,
farmer and producer of fruits and vegetables. Th following table shows the dates of first and las frosts for each year at Nashville, Tenn., from 1871

The northwest winds prevail at Nashville, th westerly come next in frequency, followed in thei order by those from the south, southwest, south-
east, east, north and northeast. Contrary to pop-
ular belief, the month of March does not show th greatest hourly and total wind velocities. Jan-
uary is accredited with the highest hourly an total wind movement, with only slight difference between the velocities of February and March The winter months show a greater total win movement, but the hourly maximum wind veloci-
ties, or extremes, usually occur during June and
July. The high wind velocities in the winte months are of a more steady and uniform charac-
ter. To illustrate: During the passage of a col wave, accompanied by an area of high atmospheri pressure, across our State from the northwest to-
ward the southeast, the winds in front rarely ex-
ceed a maximum velocity of 48 miles per hour,
and often blow at an actual rate of 30 to 35 mile from lour to six hours continuously. The violen gusts of wind before a thunder-storm in summer.

No other class o especially in June and July, are more to be dreade than the high winds of winter. It may also hap-
pen that these gusts are not always confined t one particular spot alone, immediately in front o a thunder-storm, but that several other gusts ma be moving in the same direction in common wit the thunder-storm, parallel to each other, and a short distances apart. Tornadoes are most fre-
quent in the spring and summer months. Thei possible occurrence in winter, most notably in
January and February, can be easily accounted
All records accessible relating to tornadoe in this region during the winter months for th past twenty years prove that the seasons were un-
usually mild ; that the winds came from som southerly point, and thus admitting of a heav indraught of air from the excessive moist regio further southward with steep temperature gra-
dients, therefore producing the violent whirls com-
mouls termed tornadoes. This type of storms i not of a separate lass; they usually occur within
75 to 400 miles from the center of the large storms, and in their southeast quadrants. Unlike
Georgia, Alabama and Northern Mississippi, thi region is remarkably free from tornadoes. Durin the past thirty years two destructive storms o this class were experienced here, namely, June -,

of the investigator than the tornado. Enoug facts have already been developed to prove tha there is a uniform lair of tornadoes just so sure a the unknown law of precipitation prevails. Whe these two important links in the science of mete-
orology are connected, the solution of the remain-
ing problems will be an easy task One thing of the greatest importance, and on to which the least attention is paid, and the mos ditficult to obtain, is the relative amount of mois-
ture in the air, or, as it is usually called, percent-
age of relative humidity of the air. Since climati changes afl'ect very largely the health of a com-
munity, as well as soil-character and drainage, i becomes highly important to study the moistur of the atmosphere, both relative and absolute-
the precipitation, the wind directions and veloci-
ties direct, and to note the relations existing be-
tween the purity and quantity of the wir which i inhaled; the exhalations emitted from moist soils;
their capacity for retaining moisture, and th rapidity with which they dry; the depth of well-
water, etc.--all require the earnest and thought-
ful co-operation of the meteorologist with that o the pathologist. We are as much in need of pre-
ventive medicine as curative medicine. In thi respect, as well as in all that relates to tempera-
ture, Nashvillians enjoy a moderately dry atmos-
phere, as shown by the following figures: The an-
nual average of the percentage of relative humid-
ity of the air is 68.7 per cent., and for the seasons:
Spring 65.4 per cent , summer 67.1 per cent., au-
tumn 70.1 per cent., and winter 72.1 per cent In the subjoined table of averages appear th results of the observations made by the United

STATE BO ABB OF HEALTH BULLETIN The average annual precipitation amounts to
51.88 inches, and for the seasons as follows:
Spring 14.09 inches, summer 13.47 inches, autumn
10.29 inches, and winter 14.03 inches. The averag amount for the growing season, from March to
October, inclusive, is 33.9") inches. The utility o knowing the rainfall is sufficiently obvious. It study is of great interest to the agriculturist; th development of his productions, as well as hi daily labors, are dependent upon the excess o deficiency of rain. As rain is an important sourc of water supply to our river, reservoir and th like, it is evident that a knowledge of the rainfal for any season or month, as furnished by average of the observations of former years, may be th means of enabling our hydraulic engineers to es-
timate the future water supply. Heavy rainfal bears a close relation to soil drainage, and is on of the most important from a sanitary point o view. The vulgar term "a regular gully-washer"
is of more significance than one would suppose Aside from the few inconveniences of having  cellar partially flooded here and there by a heav rainfall, our streets are thoroughly cleansed—
causes effluvia to disappear and carries off al garbage, thereby lessening disease. The follow-

September, inclusive, show the greatest number,
with a maximum number in June. A careful stud of the seventeen-year record of clear, fair ani cloudy days reveals a clear weather period durin the first two weeks in October. The so-called
"Indian summer," or hazy condition of the atmos-
phere, becomes more prevalent in September and
October, though its appearance is not uncommo in any month of the year Observations for ozone, begun upon request o the State Board of Health, have not been in forc for a sufficient length of time to obtain any defi-
nite results. Suffice it to say that the two ex-
tremes in the coloration of the iodide-potassium-
coru-starch tests—alsolute zero to 10 deg. on th scale—have already been reached during the pas two years of observation. True records of ozon cannot always be obtained in the city, more espe-
cially in the winter, since the carbonic and sul-
phurous gases arising from combustion of fuel hav a tendency to darken the test-papers more so tha from natural causes. The mean of ozone for th past two years' record is as follows: For the a. m.
observation, 0.9°; p. M. observation, 1.2° The mean annual height of the Cumberland
Kiver is 10.6 feet. The month with the highes mean is February, which stands at 21.3 feet, an the month with the lowest mean is October, 2.3
feet. The highest water during the past sixtee years, 54.6 feet, occurred in January, 1882; th lowest, 0.4 feet below zero of the gauge, aero o the gauge being low water of September, 1863—
occurred in October, 1876, the extreme range o the Cumberland being then 57 feet The high water of January, 1882, will long b remembered. During the period from Jan. 11 to
Feb. 22, 2,680 families were rendered homeless Should this community be threatened with anothe flood such as that, all danger can be averte through the timely assistance from the specia river stations of the Signal Service on the upper
Cumberland, established in December, 1885 Navigation on the Cumberland closes betwee the 5th and 20th of July, and is resumed betwee tho 10th and 25th of November. During the pas seventeen years navigation remained closed bu once during the autumn. This occurred in 1876 On July 16, 1876, navigation was suspended, re-
maining so until July 21, 1876, when it was re-
sumed, continuing until Aug. 19, 1876. Fro this time on throughout the remaining months o the year the water was exceedingly low. A sever cold wave set in during the last three days of tha year, chilling the light body of water rapidly, s that by the morning of Jail. 1, 1877, its surfac became congealed to the thickness of severa inches. This state of affairs existed until Jan. 7,
1877, at which time a rapid rise from the head-
waters caused the ice to move. The shortest pe-
riod during which navigation was suspended oc-
curred in 1882. which shows a record of seventy -

Consumption in Animals and Men The first session of the Congress for the Stud ol Tuberculosis iu Men and Animals was held in
Paris ou the 25th and 31st of July last, under th presidency of Prof. Chauveau The presence of bacillus in cases of tubercule i now almost universally accepted as the most rea-
sonable theory, and the efforts of practitioners ar directed to the destruction of this element. I the treatment so far has not met with much suc-
cess those interested may find more if they direc their attention to its prevention The conclusion of the Congress is that the sourc of infection is in the use of food infected with tu-
bercle and that to prevent the spread of tubercl it is sufficient to thoroughly cook the meat an always to boil the milk. The following were th principal subjects of deliberation:
1. More extensive powers should be given t boards of health, and the general surveillance o committees on epizootics should be given to them,
and consequently the diseases of animals and al questions relating to the contagions of domesti animals, even those which heretofore have no been considered transmissible to man, should b submitted to them
2. The Congress has seen with satisfaction tha tubercular diseases among cows has been place among contagious diseases, and the decree ha been signed by the President of the Republic.
3. It will be necessary to insist firmly on th necessity of seizing and destroying all the meat o animals affected with tuberculosis, wherever ma he the place from which they come, or whateve may be their apparent health.
4. These considerations are applicable to ever country in the world, because wherever the plac may be the question of tuborculosis presents th same problems for solution as in France.
5. It is necessary to distribute among the peo-
ple, especially in the country, such plain and in-
telligible instructions as wilfenable them to guar against the dangers of eating the meat or drinkin the milk of tuberculous animals. They shoul also be instructed as to the best means of disin-
fecting animals aud animal excreta, and of enablin them to destroy all the germs of disease.
6. Cows intended for the production of mil should be subject to a special supervision to pre-
vent the milk of any tainted with contagious dis-
ease from being offered for use. and this supervis-
ion should extend alike to all establishments i which animals are kept for such production.—San-
itarian Sanitary Science and Military Life.
A quarter of a century ago the death rate in th guards was 20 per 1,000; it is now 6£ per 1,000,
due to applied sanitary science, and, as I coul show, it is yet much too high. The death rate i the home army was 17 per 1,000; it is now about
8 per 1.000. But Germany beats us with he death rate of 5 to 6 per 1,000. In France it is 10
per 1,000, in Austria 11, in Italy 11, in Russia 18,
an army death rate three times heavier than iu
Germany. The old Indian array death rate was
69 per 1,000; from 1879 to 1884 the death rate wa reduced to 20 per 1,000, and now it is about 14 per
1,000. In the six years from 1879 to 1884 the ag-
gregate saving was 16,910 lives, aud, on the mili-
tary estimate of £100 per life, the saving in mone during these six years (as estimated by our lat eminent sanitary ally, Prof. De Chaumont, of Net-
ley, whose loss is greatly to be deplored) was
£ 1,691.000; and, at the present reduced rate of 14
per 1,000, the saving may again be reduced in pro-
portion.—Edwin Chadwick, C. B.
♦
Sanitary Science and Civil Life Nowhere in this country has the sanitarian been mor energetic than in the lower valley of the Mississippi Typhoid fever is never absent from New Orleans, and,
with no other change in conditions except the enforce-
ment of sanitary regulations, the death rate from tha disease has been reduced from 68 per 100,000 of populatio to 10 in less than twenty years; and the decrease has ex-
actly kept pace with the sanitary improvements. An here is a place for comparison. The sewage of New Or-
leans cannot pollute the water supply, rain water fro huge tanks being used. In Philadelphia, where the wate is known to be contaminated, the death rate from th same disease has increased from 56 to 66 per 100,000 in th same period. Pennsylvania has at last found it expedi-
ent to establish a health board. In Michigan the savin of life from scarlet fever in the last eleven years amounte to 3,718; and in 1880 appropriate sanitary measures save the lives of 298 persons, who, under the usual condition and according to former epidemics, would have died o diphtheria in a few localities. In Nashville the deat rate has been reduced in fourteen vears from 84.f>5 per
1,000 to 10.36 per 1.000. In Memphis the death rate ha been reduced in six years from 35 per 1,000 to 23.8 per
1,000. In Chicago the death rate has been reduced in th last rive years from 26 per 1,000 to 19.46, a saving of nearl twenty thousand lives. These important facts arc littl in comparison with the incalculable work that is bein done in most of the large centers of population through-
out the country, and are thrown out as simple indica-
tions that things are done to justify the confidence of th public in measures of public health. Defective statistic leave the best work unnoted. In Massachusetts, wher statistics are collected, sanitary regulation has reduce the death rate from infectious disease in ten vears from
28.6 per 100,000 to 18.5.—J. If. Kaine.

REPORT FOR OCTOBER, 1888 There wore no special features during th month of October except the low temperatur mean and the large percentage of cloudiness an proportion of rainfall. There were no very hig winds and but few electrical disturbances The mean temperature was 54°.C, nearly fou degrees less than the October moan of the pas six years and the lowest during that period, ex-
cept in 1880, when it was about the same. Th highest local mean was 57°.5, recorded at Coving-
ton, aud the lowest 51°.4. recorded at K>>gersvilk'
and Spriugdale. The maximum temperature ob-
served was 84", recorded ou the 1st at McKenzie.
and the lowest October maximum during the pas six years. The minimum temperature was 29°,
recorded on the 14th, at Lawrenceburg, and wa the highest. October minimum recorded in th period above named. The maximum tempera-
tures were generally recorded about the 1st aud
18th in the Western division and about the 18t and 19th in the other divisions, and the minimu about the 14th and 21st in the Western divisio aud about the 14th. 21st and 29th in the Middl division, and the 21st aud 29th in the Easter division. The daily ranges of temperature wer generally less than normal. There wore thre cold-wave warnings sent out during the month,
viz., 2d, 5th and 19th, two of which, the 2.1 and
19th, were verified, and proved of inestimabl value throughout the State to farmers, stock-
breeders, florists and gardeners. The warning o the ">th was not fully verified. On the 28th and
29th a cold wave occurred, for which no warnin was given. At Nashville the temperature fel from 61° on the 28th to 38° on the 29ih The mean depth of rainfall was 4.0G inches,
most of which fell during the latter half of th month. From the 19th to the 28th inclusiv there were almost constant rains, some of the very heavy, particularly those of the 19th, through-
out the State, and the 25th and 26th mostly i the Eastern division. Of the total amount whic fell during the month the Eastern division re-
ceived by far the greater proportion, an averag of nearly six inches, while the Middle division re-
ceived an average of three aud a quarter inches.
and the Western division about three inches The greatest rainfall was 7.22 inches, reported at
Audersonville, and the least was 1.40 inch, re-
ported at MeKeuzic. The greatest local dail rainfall was 3.00 inches, reported at Fostoria, o the 26th. The next greatest was 2.0C inches, at
Waynesboro, ou the 19th. and 2.00 inches, at
Audersonville, on the 26th. Prom the 1st to the
15th the raius were generally light. The 19th wa the day of the greatest rainfall during the month There were nine days on which no measurabl rainfall was reported.

Well Water The well on the farm is a source lrom whic comes many diseases. Some wells are neve cleaned. When dug they are carefully boarde over, the pumps made tight and snug, with th ground sloping away on all sides, so as to allo the surface water to flow from the opening. Ther is no well water that is pure. Something depend on the character of the soil. If sandy, and th water will quickly disappear from the surfac after a rain, the well will drain the soil for a lon distance around it, and the consequence will b that a large portion of the soluble filth of the soi will find its way into the well, although the wate may appear sparkling and bright. It is contende that the soil removes all the impurities from th water, but this depends upon whether the soil, b long-continued absorption, be not already s thoroughly saturated with impurities as to refus to take up more. That the soil docs not remov all impurities, even from new ground where  well has been recently dug, has been demonstrate by staturating the surface earth at a distance fro the well with kerosene oil, which gradually foun its way to the well (having been washed down b the rains) and imparted its odor to the water. I the soil be of heavy clay the danger will b lessened, but on all porous soil the liability of pol-
lution of the water is great. No manure heaps,
privies, sinks or other receptacle for filth or refus of any kind should be within 150 feet of the well—
the further off the better. No matter how tigh the well may be the toad will sometimes continu to get in. Many wells contain toads that die an are swallowed in the drinking water unknowingly,
under the supposition that the well is tight and
"toad-proof." Wells should be thoroughly cleane at least once a year, and especially in the fall For a distance of ten feet around the well the sur-
face should be cemented, and the pump it-sel should be cleaned occasionally. Toads, flies,
bugs, worms, and even gnats, will get in th water, while only a few drops of a solution from  filthy drain or sink, finding its way into the well,
will carry bacteria enough to rapidly multi-
ply aud contaminate all of the water. Roots o trees and vines also serve as drains into the wells,
as they loosen the soil, and for that reason the should never be planted near the source of drink-
ing water.—Sanitary News.

SUBSCKIPTION,
25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postofflce at Nashville as Second Class Matter The State Penitentiary The Tennessee penitentiary was erecte in 1829—more than half a century ago. I was located, planned and constructed fo the wants, and according to the architect-
ural ideas of that time. For a quarter of  century after its construction its dead wer buried inside its own inclosure; and al garbage and excremental matter found se-
pulture in the same soil It was then situated one mile or mor from the population of Nashville—not en-
dangered by epidemics in the city, and, i turn, not endangering to any considerabl extent the city's population by any pesti-
lence that might arise within its walls. It own population was small, suffering none o the evils incident to our crowded prisons,
save only the evils of limited air space i the cells, the largest being less than one-
half the space allowed by sanitary require-
ments for one individual Now, unfortunately, all the internal con-
ditions and external environments of thi prison are changed—changed for the worse The worse for the inmates of the prison—
the worse for the population that is crowde around its walls. Inside the walls, instea of a population of from one to two hundred,
giving to each convict a cell, now, with les than one-half the State's convicts within th walls of this institution, we have five to si hundred people living in the day on thi spot of earth loaded with the excreta an dead bodies of a former generation, an packed, at night, with two or three con-
victs in each of these diminutive cells lik sardines in a box The wonder is, not that the death rate i so large, but that it is, under the circum-
stances, so small The eccentric growth of the city of Nash-
ville has swallowed up the prison. An instead of being, as when constructed,  mile without her borders, it is now in th midst of her population. And, by the con-
stant and unavoidable intercommunicatio carried on between the convicts withi and the population without through th medium of employes, a pestilence on eithe side of the walls will be transferred to th other If the prison stood on non-polluted soil,
and had been constructed and could b managed as a modern prison according t the established laws of sanitary science, then,
in the midst of the Capitol City of the State,
it would be but a blot to mar her beauty,  deformity to mortify her pride; but stand-

ing, as it does, upon a soil reeking wit poison and with death, and built, as it was,
in utter violation of every sanitary consid-
eration, it is a constant menace to the pop-
ulation around it; a festering, contaminatin sore, not only marring the beauty but en-
dangering both the health and the life o those inside and out Every consideration of humanity, of in-
terest, and of duty, not only to the miser-
able wretches immured within its walls, bu to the population around, demand that th prison site be changed and the prison re-
constructed Loose or Chained Small-pox is known to have existed fro ancient times, and to have made fearfu havoc among remote communities. Ther is no doubt that it prevailed in Hindostan,
and probably in China, before the tim of Hippocrates. In the sixth century i was carried to Europe by the Mohammed-
ans from Egypt and Arabia. It was car-
ried from the Netherlands to Germany i the same year that Columbus discovered
America. In less than half a century i was imported into America, and is estima-
ted to have destroyed six out of the twelv millions of Indians who occupied the terri-
tory of the present Union. In 1707 i destroyed one-quarter of the entire popula-
tion of Ireland These familiar historic data are full o significance to us, to-day, in Tennessee an other States similarly favored with a large
African population, most valuable for thei contributions to the material wealth of th land, and most vulnerable to because poorl protected against small-pox The first grand example of preventiv medicine, and which may be looked upo as the starting point of the great popula movement now called Statar Medicine,  system which applies by State and munici-
pal ordinances the splendid advances i physical, chemical and biological science,
to the well-being of the masses, was th result of the long, patient and thoroug researches of the immortal physician. Ed-
ward Jenner, a hundred years or more ago Macaulay gives a vivid picture of th desolation caused in England by the preva-
lence of small-pox before the discovery o vaccination. "That disease, over whic science has since achieved a succession o glorious and beneficent victories, was the the most terrible of all the ministers o death. The havoc of the plague had bee far more rapid; but the plague had visite our shores only once or twice within livin memory; small-pox was always present,
filling the church-yards with corpses, tor-
menting with constant fear all whom it ha not yet stricken, leaving on those whos lives it spared the hideous traces of it power, turning the babe into a changelin at which the mother shuddered, and makin the eyes and cheeks of the betrothed maide objects of horror to her lover. During th century previous to the discovery of vacci-
nation, small-pox is calculated to hav destroyed 45,000,000 of the people of
Europe."
Jenner investigated in a scientific an practical manner the popular belief that
"one who had had cow-pox could no take small-pox, and performed in 1775 th first vaccination with cow-pox virus. Afte the introduction of vaccination into Swede the annual death rate from small-pox fel from 1,973 to 479 Per million, and afte vaccination was made compulsory this aver-
age was further reduced to 180 per million In the German army during the Franco-
Prussian war all soldiers entering the arm had to be re-vaccinated, and there wer only 263 deaths from small-pox; in the
French army this was not required, an there were 23,368 fatal cases of this dis-
ease. The sum total of men in thes armies was not far from equal Estimating the population of Tennesse at 1,835,000, the probable annual mortality

from small-pox without the system of pre-
ventive measures resulting from Jenner' discovery would be 3,640. Imperfectly a this system is carried out within the Stat the annual mortality from small pox is, s far as can be ascertained from our wretch-
edly incomplete returns of vital statistics,
only a few units; in some years none.
A settled point it is that vaccination i the prophylactic against small-pox in th individual. Inspection, isolation, disinfec-
tion and vaccination protect the commu-
nity In Tennessee there can be no doubt tha a very large number of persons have neve been vaccinated, and that multitudes nee re-vaccination. Many intelligent practi-
tioners of medicine estimate the number o our people who are unprotected by vacci-
nation and hence exposed to small-pox, if,
by accident or otherwise, they come in con-
tact with, or near to, infected persons, a at least one-fourth. Others even place it a high as one-third. At all events, the negli-
gence on this point is as inexcusable as i is alarming. It is a disgrace to the medica profession of the State, who should loo better after their wards than this. It is  reproach upon our county and local board of health, which have been repeatedl warned within the past few years by sever epidemics in other portions of America an by outbreaks in our own State, which, i some instances, have laid heavy costs upon
•city or county, and in all cases have onl been prevented from spreading into exten-
sive epidemics by the energetic action o the State Board of Health This negligence of family physicians an this lethargy of county and local board should be no longer tolerated by an intelli-
gent community. Parents should see to i that all the members of their families ar guarded from a most loathsome disease,
which may be taken from neglected bed-
ding in a sleeper or from sitting near an in-
fected passenger in an ordinary railwa coach. Instances enough of this descrip-
tion are on record to make considerate peo-
ple careful Every city, town and village in Tennes-
see should institute a general and thoroug vaccination, systematically carried out an registered. All the poor should be vaccinate at the public expense, with the best bovin virus, and by competent physicians, wh shall keep the proper records, and give du certificate in each instance It is a pernicious error to look upon thi operation in minor surgery as one of trivia moment, which may be performed by an tyro or ignoramus. Certainly, when its ob-
ject and effect are considered, it is of first-
class importance, giving immunity from  frightful pest and security from constant un-
easiness when thrown out upon the grea stream of travel, as nearly everybody i nowadays Vaccination as a safeguard has bee much depreciated in public opinion, an also failed of due effect because of the mis-
erably stingy and ineffective manner i which it has too often been carried out b city and town boards in Tennessee. Th first serious mistake is that of complete in-
action when no epidemic occurs or i threatened, and then rushing through  large amount of work most hastily an carelessly performed in the midst of panicky-
alarm, and it may be at a very unfit season,
when the virus will not remain good an length of time. The time for thorough,
systematic, recorded and certified vaccinat-
ing, private and public, is always, an specially when epidemic fright is unknown The second error is not less fertile i fruitlessness, to-wit: The employment at  rate of compensation hardly fit for a da laborer of physicians who can find no othe patients, who are required to rush throug with the vaccination of a populous city o extensive suburbs in double-quick time, s as to make the final report of expenditure moderate and economic. This farce ought

not to be tolerated. Experts should be em-
ployed, at fair professional pay, and vacci-
nation should be perpetually in vogue There is no excuse for negligence. Goo bovine virus may be obtained through an druggist from a number of reliable vaccin farms at reasonable prices, in large or smal quantities, as needed. It is now a settle point that for all urban population thi should be used and not the humanized. I rural districts, where everybody is wel known, it may be permissible to follow th old custom of obtaining the virus from  healthy person; not elsewhere Milk and Milch Cows.
BY DANIEL V. WRIOUT, M. D.
A good cow, well kept, is a health officer i ever}* family—the best that can be had next t the family doctor—unless the doctor comes afte the cow, which, as this journal is mainly read b doctors, it would hardly be safe for us to main-
tain. In large cities the possession of a famil cow is generally unattainable, but the cities in
Tennessee are not yet very large, and there are no many of them, so that, with good management,  very large majority of Tennessee families ca keep a cow. It is for such families that the pres-
ent paper is written It is proposed here to give some attention to th breeds of inilch cattle in reference to their claim for a position in well-regulated families as th nursing mothers of the coming generation. Tw opposite types will best exemplify our meaning—
two breeds of cows which have, of late, been cul-
tivated with much skill and care by stock breeder in this State with inestimable benefits to our gen-
eral stock of cattle. These are the Jersey an the Ilolstein breeds These two are selected as being both excellen in their kinds, but widely contrasted in regard t their respective merits The Jersey produces relatively a small volum of milk, with a wonderful abundance of cream i it, while the Ilolstein gives a very large volum of milk much less rich in cream, so that even th small yield of the Jersey milk produces mor cream thau the abundant yield of the Holstein To compensate for this the Ilolstein milk is muc richer in casein (the material of cheese) than the
Jersey milk; this contrast indicates the commer-
cial destination of the two products—the Jerse dairies send butter to market, the Ilolstein dairie cheese To compare their relative adaptation for huma food (especially children's food) it should b stated that human milk contains less of bot cream and casein (butter and cheese) than th average cow's milk and mom of another valuabl constituent, milk sugar; and, as a consequence,
it has been found necessary in preparing milk fo weaned infants to dilute cow's milk with water an add sugar—milk sugar in preference to cane-
sugar.
I had some opportunity last summer of studyin the Jersey breed through the kindness of a friend,
who has cultivated that variety with great zea and corresponding success. He invited me to hi house, threw open his dairy to me, allowed me t make any experiments I de.-ired, and aided nie i doing so. The Jersey cow seems to me to be th most highly specialized animal that has been cre-
ated by artificial selection. The end aimed at b breeders has been to evolve a butter-producin animal, and to this purpose, has been sacrificed al the qualities that give value to other breeds. Th animals are small, producing little flesh and les fat, and even their milk has been specialized,
cream being its leading constituent; one speci-
men tested by the cremometer gave a ratio of one-
third cream and two-thirds of all other constitu-
ents; in short, everything the animal eats turns t cream. My friend makes his profit by selling thi in the form of butter in winter time and in sum-
mer he supplies the confectioners with their ma-
terial for ice cream For family use, supposing only oue cow to b kept, this animal would not be a judicious «elec-
tion, for in this case the fresh inilk not manufac-
tured into either cream or butter is the one thin desired; but if two can be kept, let one of the be of the Jersey type, to supply the butter fo family use, aud so secure its owner from the con-
tamiuatious of oleomargarine, hoy's lard and othe abominations which have now become almost uni-
versal in the dairy market. The milk of Jerse cows is not healthy for children for two reasons,
its excess of cream and its defect of the other val-
uable constituents, such as casein, milk sugar an lactic acid. It is true it may be diluted so as t obviate its positive evils, but this docs not remed its negative qualities depending upon the defect specified So completely are these objections recognize by breeders as applicable, not only to human bu to bovine infants, that they will not allow their
Jersey calves to suck their own mothers: the have a saying among themselves that Jersey mil is poison to calves, and they furnish them either

with the milk of other cows or their mother's mil diluted This again shows how highly specialized a prod-
uct the Jersey cow is—not a product of nature,
but of human art—in a state of nature the hree could not exist but for one generation, the calve being all poisoned with their mother's milk For the family using but one cow, then, w would recommend a different type, that repre-
sented by the Holstein breed, the milk of whic is produced in larger quantities and contains les cream, but is richer in the other nutritive princi-
ples, especially casein, an element which the
Jersey breeder would rather do without, as he
.says it imparts to his butter a tendency to gro rancid. But of the two, the casein is the mor valuable nutritive principle, being a plastic ele-
ment, capable of conversion into human tissue,
while the cream is only a hydro carbon, sub-
servient mainly to the respiratory or heat-produc-
ing function. The Holstein milk, therefore, no only is produced in greater abundance, but con-
tains pint for pint more of human nutriment While, however, we recommend animals of the
Jersey type for one purpose, and the Holstei type for another, we must not be understood a recommending the pure-blooded stock of eithe for family use In the first place the full-blooded importe breeds are too expensive for that purpose; th specialists who import and breed from them rel mainly for their profits not on the produce of thei animals, but upon their progeny; nor, in the nex place, are they so healthy or hardy as our nativ stock, or as they were in their own country prio to importation. Partly by natural and partly b artificial selection every country has produce races of animals best adapted to thrive under th surroundings furnished by that country, such a climate, pasturage, water, etc. The Holstei cattle thrive well in the deep, moist, succulen pasture of the Holstein meadows; the Jersey find a shorter but richer grass on the gently undu-
lating hills and valleys of their native island,
which, through the tempering breezes of the Brit-
ish channel, has the inestimable advantage o lasting the year through, being neither dried u l>y the summer heat, nor killed by the rigors o winter. And so our native stock has, by gradua adaptation, acquired the hardiness to resist th trials of our burning summers and freezin winters But neither do I recommeud the unmodifie native stock for our ideal family cow. Experienc has proved that the indigenous stock of any coun-
try may be improved by judicious crossing wit foreign races: thus our native stock may acquire
.improvement in regard to its butter produce by  cross with the Jersey, or, as to its flow of milk,
by a similar blending with the Holstein, and, i both cases, the improvement is effected withou impairing the constitutional stability of the nativ breed; and, in this way, we do not doubt th ultimate establishment of American races pos-
sessing the valuable milking qualities of the im-
ported stock combined with the health and hardi-
ness of the home breed To be practical, however, our advice to mate familias, in selecting a family cow, is to purchas an animal whose mother is a grade cow, possess-
ing the constitutional vigor required, and whos sire is a handsome little Alderney, if it is crea or butter that she wants, or a lordly Holstein, i she desires a copious flow of milk, rich in nourish-
ment for her growing children And in either case our fee for this good advic is a seat at her table in the strawberry season.

"You have been kind enough to forward regu-
larly to me the State Board ok Health Bul-
letin during the past year, for which accep thanks.
"On looking over the reports as received, I fin none from our county. Not being a physician, I
can't give statistics of county at large, but think
Marion county will compare favorably with an other section of the State, or, in fact, of the entire
South.
"Jasper, the county site of Marion, has between
800 and 1,000 inhabitants, and has had but eigh deaths in nearly five years.
"One was a small boy, who fell off a low build-
ing, injuring his spinal cord, from which ho lin-
gered two or threo months and died; another wa a child born with scrofula, and when it began t cut teeth it took bowel complaint and died; an-
other child died from cutting teeth and bowe complaint; one was burned to death; a woma died of puerperal disease, and the child followe soon after; one old man died of cancer, and an-
other old man of carbuncle and dissipation.
"This is our death list since 1884 in Jasper. I
do not know how long before that (as I only bega to take note in 1884) that there had been a deat in Jasper. It might have been a year or two, as
I have known it to be over a year between death here. I was born within two miles of Jasper, an my father moved to the town in 1836, where w have lived except a short time ever since."

A Lesson in Sanitation It is certainly a safe assertion that the city of
Wilmington has enjoyed several months of un-
usual health, and it is a just cause of congratula-
tion and thankfulness that this delightful condi-
tion has evidently been largely, if not entirely,
the result of the cleansing stimulated by th threatened invasion of yellow fever. As far a we can judge from the tables of the Signal
Service here, there has been no unusual atmos-
pheric surroundings to bring about the result tha we claim for the efficient work of the healt officers and their corps of laborers It is beyond dispute that the streets have bee cleaner than ever before in many years, and tha the belated doctor did not have his nose, assaulte with the odors of uncared-for privies, which hav so long made the damp air of night disagreeabl and noxious. Back lots have heen emptied o unwholesome accumulations, and alleys, where th sun was too often a short visitor, were purge of their filthy soil-coverings and put in good
•order. Streets were kept clear, or nearly so, o unsightly piles of trash, and less dependence wa placed upon the good offices of the thirsty soil t take up the deposits that have heretofore bee neglected, instead of being hauled away an burnt, as they have been this season The death-rate has been lowered remarkably,
aud the sickness less than any of our physician here could have expected. There is a valuabl lesson to town authorities everywhere in the Stat in this happy condition of things, and the hop is fostered that it will not be lost here. The publi will, we feel sure, learn that a confiding an helpful assistance to the efforts of the health au-
thorities is always to be met by the best efforts o these officials to preveut disaster, that is too dire,
very often, to be cured, if allowed to find a abiding place in a community. Let the winte months, now almost upon us, be marked by th same care for the whole town on the part of th authorities, and with the advent of the hot month there will come the feeling of safety that our ex-
perience of the past month justifies.—Xortlt Caro-
lina Medical Journal Hog cholera prevails in Hancock county, Ohio In Portage township alone more than six thousan hogs have died of the disease. — Ex.

STATE BO ABB OF HEALTH BULLETIN Is Consumption Contagious?
Au international congress of nearly five hun-
dred physicians, lately in session in Paris, wa practically unanimous that consumption, or tu-
berculosis, is contagious and transmissible be-
tween man and beast. There was unanimit also as to the prime necessity of boiling milk an cooking meat well as a preventive of much of th consumption which now inflicts the human race None of these conclusions are new, hut they de-
rive additional force from the unanimity wit which they were declared and accepted as fact well established. It was stated that if boilin milk and thoroughly cooking meat are practice as a rule, one of the leading causes of tuberculosi will disappear. Hy tuberculosis is to be under-
stood not consumption alone, but various othe forms of the same disease, and also meningitis,
white humors, and scrofula. It seems to hav been very generally admitted by the congress tha tuberculosis may be easily communicated throug the digestive organs by our food, or through th blood by inhalation. The expectoration of a con-
sumptive dairyman carelessly spit upon the ha which the cow eats may give the animal consump-
tion, and she in turn may distribute the seeds o the disease through her milk or flesh to the huma family. People of robust health and strong con-
stitution may escape the contagion, but the pro-
portion of those liable to it under these circum-
stances is very large. The statement was mad by one of the leading members of the conferenc that over a fifth of the population of the worl dies of tuberculosis. The congress did not discus so much the subject of the cure of the disease a the features of its origin and prevention. Th central lesson of the meeting is summed up in th warning to "Beware of saliva, cook your mea right, and boil your milk thoroughly." Con-
sumptives should not be shut up in close or ill-
ventilated rooms, but should sleep with ope windows and take all the fresh air possible Various remedies have boen suggested, but the are at best palliatives, and yet the doctors wer careful to have it stated in the published report of their proceedings that they do not say that th disease is incurable. The revivifying and cura-
tive virtues of open air life, night and day, in  suitable and mild climate, are said to be wonder-
ful. The air should be dry and bracing, and th food wholesome and nourishing.—Baltimore Sun Infection From Books The American Analynt has, on several occasions,
called attention to the disease-carrying qnalities o many of the books in our circulating libraries These volumes passing through a multitude o hands, become in time soiled and ultimately im-
pregnated with dirt to such an extent as to ofte render them repulsive to the eye and correspond-
ingly offensive, if not dangerous, to handle There is a wide-spread impression that librar books, after reaching this stage, are potent ve-
hicles of disease germs, and the managers of man public libraries in Europe have introduced meas-
ures for disinfecting them. Wo have not heard o any of our American libraries having adopted sim-
ilar precautionary measures, though we know o institutions of that kind in this city which sen hooks out through the community whose appear-
ance suggests a bonfire as the only means o cleansing them. For the information of our
American librarians wo will describe the manne in which the manager of the free library in Dun-
dee, Scotland, disinfects books which make thei way back to the library from quarters of the cit in which the sanitary inspector may report the ex-
istence of some infectious di*ease. Dpon the re-
ceipt of the report notice is at once sent to th&
residents of the designated quarter having book out to retain them until further orders. Whe these books are returned to the library they ar thoroughly disinfected. The apparatus used con-
sists of a sort of closed cupboard made of ordi-
nary tinplate with a lid at the top, a wire shel half way up and a little door at the foot. Whe the hooks are returned the lid of the apparatus i opened, and the books placed on their edges, wit the leaves opened out as much as possible on th wire shelf. The lid is closed, and a sulphur pas-
tille is lit and put in at the little door on the tray In a few minutes the sulphurous fumes penetrat between the leaves, effectually destroying germ of disease, if such exist. It is only £air. however,
to state that the opinion is by no means unani-
mously entertained that books are competent t spread infectious diseases. The municipal author-
ities of Dresden, in Saxony, recently had a thor-
ough experimental investigation of this questio conducted. A number of much-used volume from the town library were taken for the purpose The dust from the leaves and covers were sown i nutrient media and cultures reared, the resul being that no microbes belonging to infections dis-
eases were found—the dust being, in fact, nothing-
but ordinary dust of a harmless character. Again,
the dirtiest leaves in the books were rubbed firs with the dry finger and then with the wet. finger In the first case scarcely any microbes were foun on the finger; in the second case plenty wer found, but all appeared to be of a non-infectiou character. Especially is it noted that there wer no tubercle bacilli. Lastly, books were soaked fo two days in spirit containing 10 per cent, of car-
bolic acid. This treatment destroyed all th bacilli, and proved harmless to the volumes. Th conclusion arrived at was that the danger of circu-
lating libraries spreading infection is very slight;
but a recommendation is given to dust books wel before reading them, and never to wet the finge in the mouth for the purpose of turning over th leaves. For our own part we believe the Dunde librarian's precautions to be more wisely founde than the Dresden officials' deductions.--Amerimn
Analyst Nature's Disinfectant The discovery of oxygen in 1774, by Priestley,
the school-master and divine, is an event secon to none other in the annals of science, when esti-
mated by its effects upon the progress of chem-
istry and physiology, and upon the life and avoca-
tions of men. This element is the most abundan and active of known substances. It constitute one-fifth of the atmosphere, eight-ninths of water,
and about one-half of the crust of the globe. I vegetable and animal bodies, it is much the pre-
dominant element. Its chemical qualities ar sneh that it may, without exnggeration, be style the main-spring in the economy of nature. It

builds and it pulls down. To tell all its wor would be to write a treatise upon chemistry, s numerous are its compounds, so important th processes to which it is necessary. Oxygen is, i truth, the chief of disinfectants. It is furnishe freely and in inexhaustible quantities by the at-
mosphere. When fresh air is named or used as  purifier, it is oxygen that does the work, for th atmosphere is a gaseous ocean, enveloping sea an land to a height variously estimated at from fift to three hundred miles, complex in its chemica composition, and constantly acted upon by light,
heat, and electricity. Among all the strange an interesting occurrences unceasingly wrought ou in its bosom, none is more worthy of notice tha the purifying action of oxygen. Rasping, biting,
filing, it eats out and renders harmless all sub-
stances harmful to life exposed to its action. I the long list of costly, cumbersome, and of stinking disinfectants, uoue excel and but on equals * oxygen in decomposing and purifyin efficacy. It is worth a thousand-fold the whol complicated series, and one-tenth the time spen by our children in repeating the multiplicatio table would put the wholo community in the wa of utilizing its priceless value, and increase th public wealth by untold millions.—Exchange Meat Inspection Necessary Only healthy animals should be used for food i a fact which has long been demonstrated to th most super6eial observer The signs of health are: The animal move about and appears lively, by applying gentle pres-
sure on the loins it does not evince pain, the eyo are clear and bright, the hair is glossy and th skin has a pliant feel, the body well formed an nourished, digestion, assimilation and ruminatio well carried on After skinning the animal we should not fin boils, tumors nor spots of extravasted blood in th sub-cutaneous areola tissue. The meat should b firm and have the characteristic rose color. O opening the chest, there should be no putrid, ba smelling exudations, no tubercles, no whit patches or ulcers, no difference in color, and n disease in the surroundings of the lungs In the stomach and intestine, we should find n red spots, soft, gray or black patches, no dr black remains of the food In the human being many of the most malig-
nant diseases are caused by eating diseased meat At Naples in 1617 over sixty thousand person died from eating the meat of animals that had die of malignant murrain. The same grevious mur-
rain that affect our cattle to this day, iu all trop-
ical and semi-tropical climates Dr. Most cites the following cases: A man con-
tracted a malignant fever and died after saltin the meat of an ox which had been sick with mur-
rain.
A family died after eating the meat of a ho which had been sick with angina In Marburg, Steirmark, several persons died o hydrophobia, who had been eating meat from cat-
tle which had been bitten by a mad dog. (Jour-

and when used for food they produce very grea irritation of the stomach and bowels, followed b uausea, vomiting, purging and great prostration To avoid poisoning or parasitic infection fro meat always procure fresh, wholesome meat an thoroughly cook it. The cooking process will de-
stroy the life of the parasitic embryo and rende them harmless If the living eggs of the human tapeworm ar fed to young bovine animals, in the course o time the animals become infected with the cycti-
cerus referred to above, and if they are used fo food, aud the meat not thoroughly cooked, th tapeworm is reproduced in man.—Flarius J Smith, I). V. S.

istence twelve years. The objects of the Societ are: (1) to create and educaie public opinion wit regard to sanitary matters in general, by the ai of the platform, the press, and other suitabl means; (2) to induce aud assist people, by per-
sonal influence, example and encouragement t live in accordance with recognized laws, whoreb health is maiutained and disea-e prevented; (3) t seek the removal of all noxious influences delete-
rious to the public health, and to influence an facilitate legislation in that direction. It is sus-
tained by members who pay five shillings a year An interesting feature is the meetings for wive and daughters. A series of lectures are given b women, the topics being in the usual orthodo line—circulation und respiration; the skin; clean-
liness; nursing the sick; cooking; dress; acci-
dents, etc. The Society has a large and well pat-

ington Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society American Journal of Obstetrics. He thitiks that
Ellis is in error in giving the average mortality o the disease as one in fifteen, and that it, is muc lower. Among the negroes of the District of
Columbia, who make up not more than a third o the population, the mortality, he says, is both rel-
atively and actually greater than among th whites. This, lie thinks, plainly demonstrates th potency of insanitary environment iu producin death from measles, for the negroes generally liv in the utmost squalor.—The New Tori- Medical
■Journal Diphtheria from Birds and Other Animals It has been known for some years that birds an poultry are subject to a disease which correspond to what in the human being is known as diph-
theria. Several foreign observers have gone  step further, and have endeavored to show tha the disease is capable of transmission fro animals to human beings. Last year Dr. Turne drew up an interesting report for the local govern*
ment board, bearing on this alleged transinissibil-
ity, and he adduced a large number of observa-
tions which seemed to indicate a connection be-
tween a diphtheritic affection, not only iu fowls, bu in rabbits aud cats, and a similar affection in man The report compared several instances iu whic the "strangles" in horses appeared to give rise t a like train of symptoms. In a thesis by Dr Menzie, the transmission of the disease from ani-
mals to man is attributed to the dejections of th former. Diphtheritic affection among fowls ar very common iu Italy, and he quotes an instanc iu which four out of five children of a medica man were attacked and died. In this case he in-
criminates the thatched roof, which was inhabite by colonies of fowls, geese, pigeons, etc The de-
jection of these animals, washed off by the r*in.
found their way into the cistern or well fro which the supply of drinking water was drawn.—

REPORT FOR NOVEMBER, 1888 The features for November were the large per-
centage of cloudiness and a higher degree of tem-
perature than usual for the month. There wa very little electrical disturbances, and few hig winds The mean temperature was 49 .1. about two
-degrees above the November mean of the si years past, nnd the highest during that perio since 1883. The highest local mean was 52°.2,
recorded at Austin, aud the lowest was 40°.7, re-
corded at Lawrenceburg. The maximum temper-
ature observed was 86°, on the 2d at Waynes-
boro, and was two degrees higher than the maxi-
mum observed in October, and was the highest
November maximum by four degrees during th six 3~ears past. The minimum temperature ob-
served was 19°, on the 27th at Hohenwald, an on the 28th at Lawrenceburg : this was the highest
November minimum during the period abov mentioned. The maximum of temperature wa generally recorded m the Eastern division on the
7th: iu the Middle division ou 1st. 2d. 7th, an in the Western division ou the 1st. The minimu of temperature whs generally recorded on the
27th. The ranges of temperature were les than usual for November. There were two col wave warnings—the 9th and lGth—both of whic were verified, and proved of great benefit. At
Olarksville. in the first instance, the temperatur fell from (54° to 38°, and iu the second it fell

ary 8 and 9, 1889 The Board met pursuant to law on Tues-
day, January ist. There being no quoru present, it adjourned to meet on Tuesday,
January 8th. Accordingly the Board me at 11 a. m. January 8th Present—J. D. Plunket, President; Da-
vid P. Hadden, P. D. Sims, Daniel F Wright, and J. M. Safford Absent—G. B. Thornton and p. W. Cole The minutes of the last meeting of the
Board—October i6th—were ordered rea by the Secretary, which was done. The were, upon motion, approved The Secretary then read the following re-
port:
Okkick State Board op Health,
Nashville, Jan. 8, 1889 Or. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health:
Sir—By reference to the "Acts of the State of
Tennessee passed by the Forty-Third General As-
sembly," it will be seen that nearly pix years ago
.. 6.
action was taken in regard to the unsanitary con-
dition of the state-house. On page 418 of the
"Acts" appears the following joint resolution:
"Be it resolved by Ihe General Assembly o the State of Tennessee, That the State Board of
Health be requested to examine into the presen mode of heating and ventilating the capitol build-
ing, and report the effect the same has upon th sanitary condition of the building, and if neces-
sary, in their judgment, to recommend such cor-
rection as may be deemed advisable, and to furthe report some means by which to put the water close in a better sanitary condition."
Approved March 14, 1883 On March 20th the State Board of Health mad a report to the General Assembly urging certai improvements. (See second report of this Board,
pages 32-37) But little improvement has resulted from thi effort. Perhaps because, owing to the near ap-
proach of the end of the session and the pressur upon the treasury of the State at that time, no pe-
cuniary provision was made for the same As a matter of fact the great State of Tennes-
see, with an industrious and enlightened popula-
tion of nearly two million souls, and with a cli-
mate and resources envied by all, does house it high executive officials, its legislators, and its ju-
diciary in a grand and noble structure, destitute o the first elements of a comfortable and health habitation That this statement is too weak and not exag-
gerated will appear from the most casual inspec-
tion of the structure by any one familiar wit comfortable and healthy edifices My attention has been called to it—not fro personal observation at first, for long familiarit with the splendid structure had made me indif-
ferent to its obvious and dangerous defects,—ba from incidents given by its occupants for a serie of years There can be no doubt that the lives of individ-
ual members of the Supreme Court, of executiv functionaries, and of the General Assembly hav been shortened by exposure to the dangers of the

  p. 108 (#282)                       108
STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Capitol, resulting from bad ventilation and defect-
ive heating. Equally truo is it that many offi-
cials and others having business at the state-hons have suffered much loss of health by the same During the sessions of the General Assembly an of the Supreme Court very many persons from al portions of the State who are here for a few day go home, become invalids, and are lost sight o as owing their illness to the sanitary defects of the
Capitol Five minutes exposure to damp walls or t searching drafts have, in a multitude of recorde cases, resulted in long continued illness or i death. The occurrence of such dangers in our
Capitol must produce like effects as in all othe parts of the earth. Beyond question since thi splendid structure iras erected very many person have been injured by the gross oversight or neg-
lect of its sanitary effects. The difficulty has bee that, in the great majority of cases, the parties ar evanescent—here to-day, gone to-morrow. Henc the aggravated character of the nuisance has bee overlooked. Were this building a school-house o an asylum which the inmates occupied all th time, such defects would not be allowed for a day,
as is shown by the liberal, complete, and splendi equipment* furnished by the State of Tennesse for the heatingi ventilating, and draining of it three immense Asylums for the Insane and It schools for the Blind and for the Deaf and
Dumb. The contrast between the sanitary outfi of tho state-house, and that of each of these Stat charities is most striking. For the latter all th resources of modern science have been called int requisition without regard to cost. For the for-
mer nothing has been done. The Capitol, archi-
tecturally a noble copy of the classic Greek, is, fo living purposes, worse than a barn The remedy is simple. The General Assembl now in session should at ouce have plans and spec-
ifications for the needed improvements furnishe by competent experts, get bids for the same fro reliable contractors, and appropriate the su needed in the premises The year 1888 has been marked by tho occur-
rence of small-pox within the State for tho firs time since 1885, the years 1886 and 1887 havin elapsed without a single caso. The large cities of
Memphis and Nashville, and also the populou counties of Obion and Kntherford, were invade and threatened with great damage. Prompt ac-
tion on the part of the proper officials averte the danger, and in eaoh locality the plague wa stamped out with comparatively small expens and loss of life. The number of cases reporte for the year were 66; deaths, 6 The great event of the past year was the ont-
break of yellow fever in Florida, the occurrenc of which was fully foretold in my report of Jan.
3, 1888, and indeed was generally anticipated b students of epidemics throughout America. Th thorough isolation of the entire State was a wor requiring promptness and sagacity. It was per-
fectly done, and gave great satisfaction to all ou people, especially to those residing in such por-
tions of Tennessee as in 1873. 1878, and 1879 ha suffered from this pestilence. To the outsid world it was a demonstration that Tennessee ca be kept absolutely free from this product of th tropics and filth. The value in all points of vie of this demonstration can scarcely be placed to high For the coming year reports received from other
State Boards of Health show that small pox i still prevalent or occurring iu mauy localities Hence the attention of all our local Hoards and o the medical profession was pointedly directed i the December number of the Bulletin to the ne-
cessity of guarding against inroads of this loath-
some disease by the recognized prophylactic—vac-
cination As to yellow fever we must not conceal the fac that the outlook is ominous. All sanitarians in the
Southern States familiar with the past are very un-
easy about the coming summer. There is but on way open to us. namely, to look the possibilitie fairly in the face and be ready for any emergency In this connection a local matter of great impor-
tance should not be overlooked. The four cities—
Memphis, Nashville. Chattanooga, and Knoxville—
each centers of great travel and traffic, visited b thousands annually, not only from Tennessee, bu from States near and far, with large floating pop-
ulations, should, without delay, provide suitabl accommodations for the care and treatment of per-
sons suffering from communicable diseases—ordi-
narily termed contagious or infectious. Such hos-
pitals should be isolated, but not at too incon-
venient a distance. They need not bo large, bu should he always equipped and ready for use, an competent physicians and nurses constantly re-
tained for service. No one can tell when suc hospitals will be wanted. These four cities ar already noted and populous, rapidly growing also,
and arc without excuse for not making such pro-
vision lor the stranger within their gates or thei own people, many in number, who cannot be wel cared for at home Herewith is appended a list of the contribution to the library during the past quarter:

J. IlKKRlRN LlKDSLKT, M.'D.,
Sfcre tury Report laid over to come up later in th meeting Dr. D. F. Wright, Chairman of the Com-
mittee on School Hygiene, reported that a yet the practical workings of the recentl introduced Ruttan heating, ventilating, an dry closet system into the public schools of
Clarksville could not be -as fully stated as h desired, and that therefore he would ask fo further time, and together, at some tim soon, he would present a supplementary re-
port upon the public schools of Nashville,
Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis, and sev-
eral other points in the State Dr. Plunket inquired what had been th result obtained with the Ruttan system in
Dyersburg, where it had been introduce some three or four years ago Dr. Wright replied that since six month after it had been introduced there he ha heard nothing; at that time it was very sat-
isfactory Dr. P. D. Sims moved that Dr. Wrigh be requested to make a tour of personal in-
spection of the public schools of the State,
and that the Executive Committee be au-
thorized to issue him such instructions i furtherance of said object as, after consulta-
tion with him, might seem necessary. Car-
ried Prof. J. M. Safford, Chairman of the
Committee on Water Supply, stated that a an early date he would present a full repor upon the water supply (artesian wells) of
Memphis Dr. Plunket said the question had bee raised in the minds of the people of Nash-
ville (a) as to what would be the sanitar effect upon the water supply or upon th healthfulness of Nashville of constructin the lock and dam, as contemplated, on the
Cumberland River just below the city, an also (£) as to what will be the effects of th filtration upon the water supply of Nashvill as proposed by the island filter; will it wholesomeness be diminished or increase thereby. Since these questions have bee raised it is proper that they should be scien-
tifically answered, and to that end he move that Dr. Safford be requested to make th proper investigation and report the result a as early a day as practicable Dr. P. D. Sims, Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Prisons, stated that the county of
Davidson and the city of Nashville are tak-
ing steps to induce the Legislature to re-
move the penitentiary without the limits o the city. Owing to the unsanitary condi-
tion of the prison and its utter unfitness i every regard for the purposes for which it i intended and the impracticability of its im-
provement, this Board has long and earn-
estly urged its removal, and is ever ready t co-operate with any movement to that end By the sale of the present site, which is no valuable city property, a suitable and de-
sirable country place could be secured an leave, it is believed, a large balance to b used in the erection of a new prison. Muc of the old material would be available; add-
ing to these resources the labor of a larg class of the prisoners, the whole change ca be effected with little or no cost to the State,
giving protection to the capital city of the
State from what is now a constant menac to her health and safety, and giving to the
State a healthful prison instead of what i now a place reeking with poison and wit death, and which would be but a charne house but for the most admirable manner o its management The Board adjourned to meet on Wednes-
day, the 9th inst., at io a. m.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Dr. Plunket, Chairman of the Committe on Meteorology, reported that the commit-
tee's endeavor has been to make this featur of the Board's work as valuable to all inter-
ests in the State to which the weather ha special application as possible, in additio to the careful compilation of meteorologica facts, month by month, as they exist in Ten-
nessee. This data would at the proper tim be utilized in deducing generalizations upo the delightful climate possessed by Tennes-
see, and its unsurpassed advantages woul be published to the world. Since Octobe i st seven new voluntary meteorological sta-
tions had been added to the list, viz.: Jacks-
boro, Campbell County; Springdale, Clai-
borne County; Leeville, Wilson County;
Franklin, Williamson County; Sewanee,
Franklin County; Lookout Mountain, Ham-
ilton County, and Clarksville, Montgomery
County. All these stations have good ob-
servers, and all give promise of great use-
fulness in the collection of meteorologica data, which without them would be lost While a few of the older voluntary observ-
ers have been somewhat irregular of late i reporting, still, with the continued faithful-
ness of the great majority of the old observ-
ers and the new ones, the average numbe of monthly reports has been kept up, an the last month shows a decided improve-
ment in the promptness and excellence o reports. There is yet much valuable terri-
tory in the State to be covered by voluntar stations, and in view of the increasing in-
terest throughout the State in meteorology,
it is hoped that a greater portion of this ter-
ritory will be covered during the presen year. The United States Chief Signal Offi-
cer has always generously aided this servic to the extent of his authority, and promise to continue to aid us so far as it is possible His hearty co-operation in the work and th increasing interest manifested among ou own people lead to the belief that this yea will be the most prosperous and importan since the establishment of the service in the
State. It may be proper to add that th great drawback in the establishment of ne stations is the lack of instruments for mak-
ing the proper observations. With thes supplied, there will be little trouble in secur-
ing new stations at all needed points Judge Hadden, Chairman of the Commit-
tee on Inland Quarantine, made a verba report, in which he urged the importanc and value of scientific quarantine when epi-
demics threatened invasion Dr. Plunket, Chairman of the Committe on Vital Statistics, stated that after carefu work and consultation with a number o leading citizens of the State, he had pre-
pared a bill providing a system of registra-
tion of births, marriages, and deaths in Ten-
nessee. This he would place at once i the hands of some member of the Legisla-
ture to be offered for the consideration o that body, and an earnest effort would b made to have it enacted into law. In thi connection he presented a communicatio from the Medical Society of Montgomery
County, pledging active co-operation in th effort to pass such a bill The Secretary's report was then taken up^
and that portion of it referring to the unsan-
itary condition of the Capitol building wa reread Drs. Safford and Plunket discussed a some length the necessity for certain im-
provements to be made, but urged tha whatever was done, even if a beginning wa only made, that it be done upon a compre-
hensive plan, which, first, should be care-
fully prepared under the direction of this
Board by experts Judge Hadden offered the following reso-
lution:
Hesolreti, That the attention of the General A s-
sembly be called to the pressing necessity of im-
proving the sanitary condition of the Capitol b systematic ventilation, heating, and drainage of"
the building upon the most improved plans as may-
be indicated after a careful survey shall have bee made by experts Seconded by Dr. Sims and unanimousl adopted The Secretary was directed to transmit

ate letter Dr. Safford in the chair, President Plunke read the following communication:
Office Board of Health,
State of Louisiana Xbw Orleans, Dec, 20, 1888 Dr. .1. I). I'lunket, President Tennessee State Boar of Health, Nashville, Term.:
Dkar SiR--The prevalence of yellow fever i a large number of towns in Florida iu the year
1888, following upon the existence of circum-
scribed centers of infection in that State in 1887,
the undisputed hibernation of the disease in som portion of the State, arc reasons for the belief tha the occurrences of 1888 may be repeatod in 1889 The energetic measures of disinfection now be-
ing practiced in some parts of that State will un-
doubtedly do much to lessen the probabilities of  redevelopment of the disease, but can hardly b expected to remove the danger entirely The quarantine systems imposed against Florid by several of the States during the past seaso were independent and separate in their action be-
yond tho interchange of assistance and courtes customary among reputable and responsible au-
thorities, and the appearance of the disease in De-
catur. Ala., and Jackson, Miss., and other places,
presumptively brought from Florida, showed tha the restrictions imposed upon communication fro infected to healthy centers were insufficient i their operation In view of the above recited facts, 1 venture t suggest that a conference be held between th health authorities of the States most exposed t danger of infection from Florida to take unde consideration the organization of a co-operativ and efficient quarantine service, and to arrange fo its details should the necessity for such arise.
I respectfully request your opinion of—
1. The advisability of this conference.
2. The date of which, if advisable, such confer-
ence should meet.
3. The place where such conference should b held
I will send this letter to the health authoritie of Texas. Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, South
Carolina, North Carolina, and tho prominent local
Board of Health of Western Florida, that of Pcu-
sacola; also to the Governors of Georgia and
Florida, neither of which States have other tha local boards, with a request that each of them, i in accordance with their views of public policy,
send an accredited delegate Should a sufficient number of the representative of the various bodies unite in recommending th holding of the conference, that place and that dat fixed upon by the majority will be announced an the invitation issued for the assembly, as being a the request of those approving of such meeting.
I respectfully suggest that Jacksonville itsel might not be an inappropriate place of meeting,
and the date should be previous to the 1st day of
March, 1889 An;answer is urgently solicited Verv respectfully,
C. P. Wilkinson, M. D. President Louisiana State Hoard of Health Dr. Plunket moved that, in furtheranc of the suggestions contained in the letter o the President of the Louisiana State Boar of Health just read, this Board do mos earnestly approve of the proposed conven-
tion, to be held at such time and place a may be agreed upon. Adopted Judge Hadden and Drs. Wright and Sim spoke upon the necessity of such a confer-
ence Dr. Sims moved that Dr. Plunket be ap-
pointed the delegate to said conference fro this Board. Adopted Dr. Safford moved that in the event Dr Plunket could not atted Dr. Thornton b appointed alternate. Adopted After examining and approving account the Board adjourned to meet on the first
Tuesday in April, 1889.

inch The U. S. observer at Memphis reports a de-
ficiency iu precipitation during the month of 0.53
inch from the normal, and since Jan. 1 of 8.24
inches Sergeant L. M. 1'indell, U. S. observer at Chat-
tanooga, reports the rainfall for the month at th following stations outside tbe State: Charleston,
N\ C, 2.06 inches; Asheville, N. C. 2.70 inches:
Murphy, N. (!., 2.10 inches; Decatur, Ala., 2.80
inches The following report from Williamsburg, Ky.,
was received through Sergeant L. N. Jesunofsky.
U. S. observer at Nashville: Total rainfall for De-
cember, 1.45 inch; greatest rainfall in fwenty-fou hours, 0.75 inch. 17th; snowfall on the 13th 1.00
inch The annual report accompanying this will b found to contain some valuable and interestin data. The annual reports of Sergt. L. N. Jesu-
nofsky. U. S. Observer at Nashville. Sergt. h. M Pindell, IT. S. Observer at Chattanooga, and Mr Frank K. Fergusson, voluntary observer at Itid-
dleton, will appear in the next monthly report,
for want of space in this It is gratifying to note that, while some of th voluntary stations in the State have been discon-
tinued, there have been added, during the pas year, several new stations with observers wh seem to bo much interested in the advancement o the service in the State, and they give promise o good results iu the collection of meteorologica data from their respective localities, and of addin very materially to the value and the interest an efficiency of the service. While this may be said,
it is but due to those voluntary observers wh have been so faithful in making the records a their respective stations during the past six years—
who have in all these years, or since the establish-
ment of their stations, given their efforts, and tha without any compensation, to advance the caus and progress of meteorology in our State—to giv them the credit and praise which justly beloug t them for whatever of value or importance the ser-
vice iu Tennessee may possess. It may be grati-
fying to them to know that, although they hav done this great and important work without an direct aid, or scarcely any recognition from the
State, their efforts have been appreciated abroad,
and they have made, and are still making a recor which will be highly valued long after they wil have passed away. It is to the voluntary servic throughout the country that one must look for th collection of valuable meteorological data whic otherwise must be lost. It is through the co-ope-
ration of the voluntary service that the National
Signal Service has been enabled to extend th practical benefits of the service to all parts of th country Flood Warnings and Area Overflowed Tablk of Average Height and Extreme Ranges of the Water at Regular and Special River Stations o the Signal Service iu the State for December, 1888:

SUBSCRIPTION,
25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postoffice at Nashville as Second Class Matter Surface Scavengering Fifteen years- ago there was not a per-
manently organized and working Board of
Health in Tennessee. In the Old World,
the great cholera plague of 1830 and follow-
ing years, have waked up the people an the rulers of the more enlightened nation to some extent. Britain took the lead an inaugurated, as a measure for the benefit o the masses, a sanitary reform which has at-
tracted the attention and admiration of th world for its costliness, completeness an good results. For cleanliness of street and back premises, London, with it crowded population of 5,000,000, is  model Democratic America has been tardy i following this example, because with us th time and talent of public men are devote to party interests and not to the welfar of the people. However, Massachusetts,
which has a syftem of local township gov-
ernment, more truly Democratic than an part of the United States, and whose citi-
zens for public spirit more nearly rival thos of ancient Greece than any people of mod-
ern times did, about twenty-five years ago,
under the leadership of a woman and of  publicist, began a movement which ha since rapidly extended over the Union Hence our public are becoming familia with such terms as that at the head of thi article. Local and State authorities ar now compelled to hear their masters wh demand drainage, the removal of night-soil,
of garbage and of street filth. Newspaper and magazines are constantly treating sani-
tary topics. And if the medical professio does not get out of its stupid lethargy, th people will soon be ahead of it in a knowl-
edge of the causes and prevention of dis-
ease If there is one topic which more than an-
other needs the attention of practical sani-
tarians in Tennessee, it is surface scavenger-
ing. This is confidently asserted from re-
peated and careful inspection on foot, of
Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga and
Knoxville, all of which wealthy and grow-
ing cities are lamentably behind in this re-
spect. The suburbs of these cities, in pop-
ulation exceeding that of our second clas cities, are in such poor sanitary condition a to justify their incorporation into the citie of which they are naturally a part no/en volens. It is a settled point in common law,
that no man has a right to be a sanitar nuisance to his neighbor. Decisions o courts recently given to this effect in a great

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
number and variety of cases, could readil be cited. Just northwest of Nashville,
within a stone's throw of the capitol, is  suburb of about twenty thousand people,
which, if not annexed to Nashville proper,
should at least be required to have a cor-
poration of its own so as to carry out prope sanitary regulations. Indeed there shoul be a general law, we may style it, of sel incorporation, which, corresponding wit nature's fiat, should attach every buildin adjacent or contiguous to an incorporate city or town to said corporation. In Ten-
nessee, and generally in America, all munici-
pal corporations are planned on too lim-
ited a scale. Hence great evils in more re-
spects than one speedily ensue. Nashvill originally included hardly enough acres t make a truck patch. Now its area is  satire upon the word city. Its limits shoul extend by a radius of three miles from the
Maxwell House all around. Thus it woul include space enough for a prosperous an healthy community The want of thorough surface scavenger-
ing is perhaps a greater evil in the small an beautiful towns and villages in Tennessee,
than it is in the large cities above men-
tioned, for these all have well organized an influential Boards of Health, which are con-
stantly pressing sanitation upon the peopl and authorities. Extensive systems o drains and sewers are planned and unde way. Garbage and night-soil services ar at work constantly. So that in these larg cities progress is made more or less rapidl to a more perfect- cleanliness of earth an air. From very extensive observation an correspondence it may be affirmed that th indifference and absolute blindness of th intelligent citizens and rulers of nearly ever beautiful village and town in Tennessee a to the supreme importance of surface scav-
engering is astonishing. In no part of th world has nature done more for the beaut and healthfulness of hamlets, villages an towns, than in West, Middle and East Ten-
nessee. Bolivar, Fayetteville and Morris-
town may be taken as types. One who ha journeyed on horseback, on foot, on the rail,
repeatedly between the great river and th great mountains, can never sufficiently ad-
mire the capacity of dear old Tennessee a the site for innumerable villages with school and churches, with homes and workshops,
for beauty and comfort more than rivalin those over which the tourists from the Sout go into raptures when traveling in the Nort or in Europe Yet when cholera and yellow fever invad the land, it is the smaller towns and ham-
lets which suffer most. This fact is an inde as to relative sanitary condition and shoul do away with the prevailing error that th small towns are healthier than the larg cities. And as time goes on the great cities,
always improving their water supply an perfecting their daily sanitary work, will be-
come more and more healthy, while th country towns neglecting surface scavenger-
ing will become receptacles of night-soil, de-
caying garbage and other filth. Inevitabl in due time the contaminated and poisone soil will impart its noxious properties to th wells and springs from which the inhab-
itants draw their water supply. Then fare-
well to any and all pretentions to healthful-
ness, and resultant pecuniary damage be-
yond computation Look at Franklin, at Gallatin, at Union
City, at Johnson City, at each and all of ou rural towns, and what do we see, but th same condition of things which, going on in
Memphis for some fifty years finally culmi-
nated in the violent explosionsof 1873, 1878
and 1879. Inevitably like effects will fol-
low upon a similar scale from like neglect,
whether the town has five hundred, fiv thousand, or fifty thousand people. Forth-
with, not from any scare as to yellow feve or any other epidemic, but in deference t the immutable laws of health, the peopl inhabiting a contiguous or adjacent set o houses should institute a surface scavenger-

ing service by which night-soil should b prevented from permeating the soil and b frequently removed, the streets and alley kept neat and free from filth, and all garbag either utilized or destroyed by fire before be-
coming offensive. All which would requir but a few hundred dollars per annum in  small community, though in cities man thousands are cheerfully expended in thi line. In Tennessee the rural towns are fa too sleepy in regard to sanitary reform an progress. Our cities are waking up—rathe slowly Lesson Not Lost The Governor of Florida has called  special session of the Legislature to con-
sider measures for protecting the publi health, and especially to take steps fo establishing a State Board of Health. I will for long years to come be matter of re-
gret with the people of Florida that, fro inexcusable supineness or lethargy, he chosen rulers did not listen to the warning of danger loudly given long before th summer of 1888. Had Florida been read to help herself much obloquy from neigh-
boring States would have been saved. Al these had just reason for complaint Again, an efficient State Board of Healt would have been invaluable as a mediu through which the assistance of the Federal
Government could have been used. Ther can be no doubt that the efficiency of thi liberal and cordial aid would have been in-
creased ten-fold by this species of co-
operation.
A Note for Nashville The London Lancet says: "In his admir-
able report upon the mortality in Englan and Wales during the ten years, 187 i-'8o,
Dr. William Ogle devoted considerabl space to the consideration of the mortalit from phthisis and diseases of the respirator organs in what he terms "dust - inhalin occupations." His figures bear a heav record against the dust of stone and th dust of metal.''
If there is any one annoyance speciall complained of in Nashville it is that result-
ing from the impalpable powder or dust int which the priable limestone composing th roadbed of the streets is ground. Washing-
ton City used to be as bad, but its splendi street improvements have done away wit the evil. So great is this evil that to live in
Nashville may be well styled, "a dust-in-
haling occupation" There can be n doubt that this frequent inhaling of ston dust is the cause of many lung diseases in
Nashville. So much the more reason fo the constant and thorough cleaning of th streets, specially the central and crowde thoroughfares. Instead of there being in-
tervals of days and sometimes of weeks i this surface scavengering, these street should be swept every night. Indeed, as  material for the central streets, limeston should long since have been abandoned River gravel, even, would be a great im-
provement Schools and Vaccination Small-pox occurred in January in som seven or more localities in Ohio. At an time we may hear of it in as many localitie in Tennessee, whence, without extrem vigilance and prompt action, it would soo become as frightful an evil as of recen years it has been in'Louisville, Philadelphi and Montreal. The large cities in Ten-
nessee have a regulation which, if adopte by every municipal corporation in the
State, would go far to protect quite a num-
ber at least in each county. Reference i had to the ordinance which prevents an child from being received into the publi schools without a certificate of vaccinatio from a physician. Of course, 'privat schools would soon fall into line. Henc in these larger towns vaccination is far more

in vogue than in country districts. Ther is no reason why even the smallest chartere town should not enforce such an ordinance Also, there is no reason why the heads o schools anywhere in Tennessee should not,
out of regard to their pupils, require certifi-
cates of vaccination from each child. Th law of the State should forbid any on from belonging to any public school with-
out such certificate Membranous Croup Dr. J. F. Kennedy, Secretary of the
Iowa State Board of Health, enforces quar-
antine as rigidly in all cases of membranou croup and diphtheritic croup, so called, a the pronounced diptheria. He thinks tha the practical effect of isolation and disin-
fection in all such cases would not only re-
strict the spread of membranous croup, bu also lessen the number of cases of diph-
theria.
A Plea for the Inspection of Cattle, Mea and Milk in the Markets of
Tennessee By Daniel F. Wright, M. D.,
Member of State Board of Health, Clarksville, Tenn The object of food inspection has as-
sumed an importance and urgency in th present day far beyond what it has demand-
ed at any former period, and I desire thi paper to be looked upon as an appeal fo immediate legislation on a matter not les threatening to the community than was th epidemic whose invasion we escaped s narrowly and with such active exertions las fall In the first place the knowledge of anima diseases and of their communicability t man has attained a copiousness and precis-
ion in the present day such as has neve been attempted till now. It was one o these cattle diseases named "anthrax," or
"splenic fever," which was the occasio with the celebrated Pasteur of entering o those studies of the microscopic germs o disease which have issued in his hands an those of others in the creation of a new de-
partment of pathology, entitled micro biology,
which has already been fruitful of inestima-
ble benefits in the treatment and prevention-
of human and animal diseases. Anthrax,
however, though not unknown in this coun-
try, is less prominent here than severa monia, foot and mouth disease renderpes other animal diseases, such as pleuro-pneu-
monia, foot and mouth disease, rinderpest o cattle plague, and lastly tubercle, more com-
monly known as scrofula Although all these diseases are of vas importance as contaminating our meat sup-
ply, this paper will be confined to the con-
sideration of the last mentioned, both be-
cause it is a more direct cause of disease i the human family, and because it is a mor imminent menace to the public health a this particular time Tubercle in cattle is the same disease a tubercle in man; it is in both the substanc characteristic of consumption when foun in the lungs, and it is not only common to-
man and the lower animals but is commun-
icable from the one to the other Tubercle is communicable from cattle t man through the breath of tuberculous ani-
mals, more directly so through eating thei flesh when insufficiently cooked (which i the fashionable way of eating beef in th present day), still more so by consumin the milk of tuberculous cows. It woul appal some mothers of families did the know the vast number of cows thus infecte which are now supplying nourishment t their children. It is among milch cow that the disease is specially prevalent, i older cows more so than heifers and mos so in cows confined the year round (as the are in cities) in stables with insufficient an insalubrious food. This progressive preva-
lence of tubercle in milk cows has bee made the subject of statistical report in Ba-
varia, as follows. We quote from an ad-
dress delivered by Dr. Klophel of Memphis,
before the International Grange Associatio and the Butchers' Protective Association:
In 1877 there were found in Bavaria
4,976, and in 1878 5,052 tuberculous cattle,
the former number being 1.62 per cent, an the latter 1.61 per cent, of all the cattle,
sound and unsound, in that country; but th relative prevalenceof the disease at differen ages and sexes renders the statement muc more significant. It prevails much mor in females than in males, and in the forme more and more with advancing age. Her is the specification of tuberculous cattle ac-
cording to age.

affected with tuberculous disease But this presents very inadequately th probable prevalence of tuberculous diseas in the great dairy sheds of our cities. In th first place, the enumeration was taken in
Bavaria, so as to iuclude the whole nation,
town and country, and without distinctio of sex, whereas it is known that the diseas is much more prevalent among cows tha among bulls or oxen, and very largely s among cows confined in city sheds and sta-
bles over'those on farms in the country,
though even there, if large numbers are kep in crowded sheds or barns the same troubl arises as in town. On both these kinds, w must add something in detail which pos-
sesses a terribly practical bearing in thi country First, then, tubercle prevails much mor among females than among males of the bo-
vine race. This may be briefly dismissed It need only be stated that the Bavaria veterinaries found tuberculous cows to b three times as numerous as bulls and oxe similarly diseased Second, as to the infinitely greater preva-
lence of tubercle among cows confined in
"byres," as they are called in Scotland,
meaning buildings with stalls for large num-
bers of cows, we must dwell on the observa-
tions of Mr. Dewar, a very eminent Scotc veterinarian who practiced in an extensiv breeding and rearing district. Quite earl in his practice he found a perfect endem-
prevalence of tubercle; he found to hi clismay that he could not cure a single case He came to the conclusion that the buildin in which the animals were confined was to close. He had called in a physician—
practiced on human patients; they mad post mortem examinations and both agree that it was tubercle, and the doctor called it
^////list's pulmonalis, as he would have style it in one of his human patients This was in 1839, at which period the ex-
istence of tubercle in the lower animals
.(except perhaps monkeys), and its infectiou character even in man, were by no mean generally admitted; neither proposition i doubted now However, Mr. Dewar continued his in-
vestigations; and, first, in a therapeuti direction, he tried to cure the disease, usin the methods prevalent in human tubercle His first attention was directed to th buildings. He 'could find no fault i them, except the want of a free circulatio of air. He says "the 'byres' were re-
cently built, and ceiled and plastered like  drawing-room. The proprietor agreed t remove the partition walls and to mak openings opposite one another on the out-
side walls, so that there might be a curren of fresh air passing through." In additio to all this, he used the medicines customar in human tubercular disease, as cod live oil and tonics, which he thinks may hav prolonged life, but not saved it, and event-
ually the whole flock died out. After  thorough cleansing of the building an burning the soiled litter, other animals wer admitted with good result, but constan vigilance was necessary to prevent the ad-
mission of infected animals or even thei offspring, for the heredity of the diseas was now admitted Other employees of his neglected th same precautions, though warned by him (fo he had now a large practice in the district),
but never neglected with impunity, and h says that "soon so many animals wer affected that the byres were infested wit the fearful malady."
I have dwelt more at large upon thes early investigations of the subject, becaus they were the occasion of developing a tid of public opinion on the subject of foo hygiene which has never ebbed, a develop-
ment which*it is earnestly desired to elici in this State Much has been done since. Methods o investigation more rigid and more logica have been applied to the modes in whic the disease is spread to the causes fro which it originates, and some of these wil be here touched on in order to account fo the facts now recognized by all expert occupied with the subject, that bovine tuber-
cle has very largely increased of late in thi country. Let us consider, then, the differ-
ent ways in which such inspection is dis-
tributed It has been found to be spread by th breath, the milk, the flesh and the sputa of

tuberculous animals, and animals of tuber-
culous parentage are specially predisposed Of infection by the breath of tuberculou animals there is ample proof; the breath o cows, for instance, is found to contain  special abundance of moisture, with whic when thus diseased large quantities o tuberculous matter pass off as fluids are dis-
persed by a doctor's atomiser; it is in thi way that animals confined in badly ventila-
ted sheds so rapidly contract the diseas from one another till a whole herd i affected. Of the milk nothing need b said; no secretion so rapidly absorbs mate-
rial, healthy or morbid, from the genera system as this. Of the flesh when eaten,
'dogs, cats and pigs have answered to th experiments of scientists by abundant evi-
dence of tubercular infection, and the sput or expectorations in the hand, of Gerluch,
Viseur and Tapeiner have given unquestion-
able results. These experimental lesion cannot be. given in detail, but it must b stated that Viseurs' description of th autopsy of a cat thus experimented upo might serve as a graphic description of th intestines and mesenteric glands of huma child dead with tabes mesenterica, of whic the present writer has dissected man specimens From all these considerations, does it no become abundantly evident, even withou the testimony of our experts to its great in-
crease of late, that tubercle once intro-
duced among our cattle, and not combatte by the most stringent methods of repression,
must increase in geometrical progression?
In what was stated about the statistics o the disease in Belgium, it would at firs sight appear that it does not necessarily in-
crease, the percentage is a little smaller in
1878 than in 1877, but this inference van-
ishes with a statement of the facts. Th exposures of 1877 led to a vigorous effor on the part of the government towar stamping out the disease, and thousands o animals were slaughtered and their carcasse destroyed; even so, however, it took year to entirely expurgate the country of it plague Here we have no repressive measures an no statistics, and we only know by genera statements and necessary inference tha tubercle must prevail to a frightful exten among our cattle and among our milkin stock especially.
I have dwelt upon this subject for urgen reasons (this acknowledged increase o tubercle throughout the country in ou herds and dairy establishments), because I
believe we are in danger of. an epidemi which will soon become very difficult, if no impossible, to eradicate, and I want to im-
press upon the people of Tennessee that th establishment of a disease among us in a endemic form is a thing much more to b dreaded than any epidemic. We have ha from time to time very frightful epidemics,
especially yellow fever and cholera, an many among us remember the alarm an terror with which the presence of thes scourges has been regarded; but how if i were to transpire that one or both of thes scourges were established among us in per-
manence, as cholera lingers in the jungle of Hindoostan, or yellow fever on the coast and among the islands of the Carribean
Sea? And yet this is exactly what is i progress of being established in this countr at this time; for bovine tubercle is a diseas which not only is highly infectious, but i one capable of originating without infection,
one which constantly does so originate, an if one tuberculous cow or ox gets into  stable or stock yard, or farm occupied b sound animals, the whole herd is liable to-
be tainted This is the reason why, in preference to-
a great many very malignant cattle epi-
demics, I have selected the endemic tuber-
cle. 1 could have given descriptions o other diseases which we have had amon us, with details to make men shudder; I
could have told of cattle plague, pleur pneumonia, big-jaw or foot and mouth dis-
ease, but, with all their horrors, these ar epidemics and can be stamped out, and tha once done we are rid of them till new case are imported, but with regard to bovin tubercle, exemption from that, like liberty,
has no less a price than eternal vigilance.
I have thus endeavored, in words a plain as I could find for the purpose, to pu forth a warning against what I believe to b a most formidable danger threatening th health of the State, and I am sensible how-
inadequate words are to express the mo-
mentous importance of the subject. O this, however, I am entirely confident tha the facts I have laid before you (and the are but a small fraction of what might b stated were there time enough) need no any rhetorical aid to enlist your most earn-
est consideration.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN There have been three or four eases of jaundice, o which it will be remembered there was almost a epidemic here a year or more ago Gibson county—Dr. T. J. Happel, County
Health Officer, Trenton.—For January I have t report an increased amount of sickness. The gen-
eral type of diseases can be denominated catarrhal-
pneumonia and bronchitis being most common There has so far been but little proportionate fatal-
ity. In two districts adjacent to Trenton, erysip-
elas chiefly of the face and head has prevailed t gome extent. Malarial fevers continue to appea occasionally. The warm, changeable winter i leaving the germs of intermittent and remitten fevers still active. I have had no reports from m county assistants up to date Milan—M. D. L. Jordan. M.D.—Seven cases o scarlatina in town during January; no deaths. A
widespread epidemic of acute-pharyngitis pre-
vailed during the month Trenton—A. S. Currey, Esq.—Slight increase o sickness during mouth, but not more than usua for January. Several cases of pneumonia reported,
but yielding readily to medical treatment. Bron-
chial and catarrhal affections common, and som few oases of whooping congh reported Giles county—Dr. G. A. Abernathy, County
Health Officer, Pulaski.—Xo report received Grainger county—Dr. J. H. Campbell, County
Health Officer, Kutledge.—No report received Greene county—Dr. E. B. Smith, County Health

cided increase in the amount of sickness in Crund county. Besides the ordinary winter diseases—
bronchitis, tonsilitis, etc., we have had during Jan-
uary much gastric and diarrhoeal troubles amon children. Some of these cases have been ver severe, though no deaths have been reported.
"With the close of the month there exists severa cases of enteric fever of a mild form. Three sud-
den deaths of young babe, cause unknown, wer reported for the month. East month I reported a epidemic of enteric fever at Sewanee. I lear that this is not strictly true. There was only on oase in Sewanee during the fall. The other case were in a neighborhood two miles from Sewane and were due to local causes Hamblen county—Dr. I). E. Shields. County
Health Officer, Morristown.—Xo report received Hamilton county—Dr. E. M. Eaton, County
Health Officer. Chattanooga.—The health of th county still continues good. I can truly say ther are no prevailing diseases Hancock county^-Dr. Jesse B. Mitchell, County
Health Officer, Datura.—No report received Hardeman county—Dr. Jas. J. Xeelv. Jr. County Health Officer, Bolivar.—The health of thi county continues unexceptioually good. With th exception of slight catarrhal attacks, there is n sickness worth mentioning. The sanitary condi-
tion of the towns havo been scrupulously looke alter, which has in a great measure prevented dis-
ease, and is the main cause of our exemption fro disease arising from that source. Since the en-
forcement of the sanitary law s, the health of th county has grown progressively better each year,
which verifies the old adage, "an ounce of pre-
vention is worth a pound of cure." I hope each

able conditions, a thin scud of cloud passing ove very rapidly from the south, forming a very beau-
tiful and brilliant corona The observer at Florence Station makes the fol-
lowing note: "Certainly a phenomenal month,
not only because of high average temperature—
about 5° above the average at this station—bu because of the rapid changes of temperature withi periods of a few hours. The total of wind mileag here was probably greater from southeast tha from any other point of the compass, northwes next."
The observer at Nunnelly notes as follows:
"This January has been the mildest for a decade,
the thermometer ranging from 19° to 65°: winds va-
riable, frequently blowing from every point of th compass within twenty-four hours, until the 23d,
when it veered to northeast and remained station-
ary for ninety-six hours, a slow rain falling durin the whole time."

An eminent German authority some tim gave as a test for the civilization of a peo-
ple, not their palaces, museums and work of art, but their backhouses. Not a ver stylish test, indeed, but yet a very truthfu one. For the highest proof of civilizatio is valuation of life, and where back prem-
ises are despised life will be shortened All persons who have given much atten-
tion to the inspection of premises are im-
pressed with the singularly unwise contras between the front and rear of city dwelling-
houses. The front rooms of our houses ar generally but little occupied, being used fo show or temporary purposes. The livin uses are mainly in the rear. Yet care, at-
tention and cost are devoted to the front,
while the rear is too often in an unkempt,
desolate state. Just the reverse should b the case. Always use rather than show With us in America it is always show befor use. We lack the English appreciation o comfort. In fact, we hardly have the no-
tion of comfort, and are constantly expend-
ing enormous sums for show and discomfort The money wasted in putting up costly iro fences separating our dwellings from th streets on which they front would go ver far toward redeeming the back yards fro unhealthy nuisances.
A municipal ordinance which forbids al animals from running at large within corpo-
rate limits would save our principal citie many thousand dollars. To our smalle towns such an ordinance would be propor-
tionately beneficial. Some ten years ag such an ordinance was brought to the atten-
tion of the people of Nashville. No on could see any sense in the suggestion. No citizens of Nashville traveling in the new
Northwest, where ideas of progress ar eagerly seized, come home speaking raptur-
ously of the extraordinary beauty of th streets, which, having no palings or fenc-
ings in front of the houses, present a beau-
tiful vista of lawn and shrubs, and allo free circulation of air and sunshine None of our Tennessee towns and citie are very old, yet in each and all many con-
taminated and foul back premises exist Specially is this true of the older and cen-
tral portions. Here may be pointed ou back lots, hid out of sight, which have bee neglected time out of mind. In the cours of twenty, thirty, it may be fifty years, thes lots have become mere masses of reekin filth, giving out emanations quite as noxiou as any sewer gas. And yet right around

these lots many people live day and night—
in summer time with doors and window open—breathing the atmosphere thus foule all the time. Sewer gas! sewer gas!! is a old cry. The books and the journals an the dailies constantly repeat it. The fat of Prince Albert, beloved in Britain, and of
Secretary Manning, honored throughout
America, give point and emphasis to thi everlasting reiteration. And verily sewe gas is no joke, seeing how many houses,
more especially of the wealthy, are poisone by defecive connections of sleeping apart-
ments with city mains. Nevertheless, i our part of the world, nasty earth gas is  far more potent cause of slow recover from illness, or of death when recover should have taken place. Many a tim when the skillful physician has been thwart-
ed in his just anticipations the explanatio would readily appear were back premise explored In many instances these premises, fro long continued neglect, have become so fou that no ordinary surface scavengering wil avail. The soil is saturated with filth t the depth of ten or twelve inches, an should be removed bodily, or else thorough-
ly disinfected Very often, however, great improvemen can be made by removing rubbish, garbage,
and other surface accumulations. All thi work should be done at once. Thus whe the hot weather sets in nothing more will b needed than daily care in preventing fres accumulations Always and everywhere in this beautiful
South-land must be urged the supreme im-
portance of cleanliness, and the beneficia influence of fresh air and sunshine all i and around our living and sleeping rooms God has given us a paradise. Too ofte we make it a pest-house Lack of Local Boards From Rowell's American Newspaper

Twenty persons in one neighborhood in LaPorte
County, Indiana, have been attacked with trichi-
nosis, and most of them will die. All are Germans,
who, at a christening recently, ate pork which ha been improperly cooked.—Ex There are, doubtless, fifty other smal towns in Tennessee to be added to th above list; not having newspapers, Rowel has no occasion to mention them All the above should have local boards o health, collecting constantly minute vita statistics, watching against the introductio and spread of communicable diseases, an guarding against sanitary defects, or negli-
gence of any character. Each town shoul be in such good sanitary order, and so well

provided with medical and nursing at-
tendance, as to be ready at any time to take
Christian care of a small-pox patient, and t maintain due equanimity of soul even whe cholera or yellow fever are in the land, and,
in spite of all precautions, might drop dow in its midst. Such a state of preparatio will make all diseases go lighter, and pro-
mote recovery and escape from prematur death. This is the proper aim and true re-
ward of sanitary reform Epidemic alarms and realities are occa-
sional and fleeting. Yet the lessons taugh by them have always made a profounde and more lasting impression than the perma-
nent and beneficent results of constant goo sanitary work. And surely no one lesson i more thoroughly and repeatedly taught b such visitations than the vital importance o real sanitation to communities of very lim-
ited population The first great cholera epidemic of 1833
made its mark even more conspicuousl upon Shelbyville and other at that perio very small towns than upon Nashville. Th last terror from this visitant, in 1873, was a much felt in Goodletsville, Gallatin, Mur-
freesboro, Shelbyville, Lebanon, Palmyra,
Farmington, Ooltewah, Greeneville, Erin,
Union City, Clinton, Wallace Cross Roads,
Jonesboro, Elizabethton and Rogersville a in the large cities The yellow fever of 1878 made its mar upon Humboldt, Jackson, Milan, Mason's
Depot, McKenzie, Paris, Gadsden, Belle's
Station, Brownsville, Shelby Depot, Somer-
ville, Williston, Wythe's Depot, Union
City, Martin, Grand Junction, LaGrange,
Moscow, Germantown, Galloway, Frayser's

Dancey ville, Bethel Springs, Stanton Station,
no less than Memphis and Chattanooga The world-famous epidemic of typhoi fever of occurred, not in a city, but in Ply-
mouth, a small inland town of Pennsyl-
vania, and led to the establishment of the
Pennsylvania State Board of Health The recent epidemic of yellow fever ha given quite a number of small towns in
Florida a national reputation for shamefu want of cleanliness In view of such facts as the above, whic have now for ten long years been repeatedl pressed upon the attention of the medica profession, the proper guardian of the pub-
lic health, and equally thrust before the eye of all municipal and county authorities in
Tennessee, who are by law invested wit grave responsibilities in this behalf, it i astonishing that so little progress has bee made in organizing local boards of health,
working in unison with the State Board By references to the pages of the Bulle-
tin it will be seen that about seven suc boards make regular reports. It will als be seen that several cities which by the let-
ter or spirit of the law are required to kee full mortuary records and report the same,
have paid no attention to this importan matter, thus doing themselves the injustic of a negative notice of ill-health. This re-
mark applies to every town in the abov list of 2,000 or more, which does not b law require death certificates before burial However, the people are waking up t the axiom that prevention is better tha cure — prophylaxis than therapeutics. I the next few years Tennessee will alig itself with the live Northwest in this vita matter of local sanitation, and thus mak itself worthy of the rich gifts with which i has been endowed by nature The United States Cholera Commissioner About one year ago we alluded to th fact that though Dr. E. O. Shakespeare, of
Philadelphia, had been appointed in th fall of 1885 United States Cholera Commis-
sioner, and did at that time go abroad fo the ostensible purpose of investigatin cholera, then raging in southern Europe,
yet, no report of his mission had ever bee made by him, so far as this board coul learn, and we raised the question why?

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN The riddle, no one in this broad land i seems, has been able to solve, until a fe days ago we were permitted to see the fol-
lowing letter, which establishes the tw points: (a) That E. O. Shakespeare, M. D.,
is a reality, and not a myth; (b) that as soo as the portrait of his highness—the microb can be properly executed, so all may se and know him as he is, the report, it i promised, will be filed with the governmen for publication:
Department of State,
Washington, Feb. 5, 1889 To the Hon. J. E. Washington, House of Repre-
sentatives:
Sir—In reply to your letter of the 30th tilt., in-
quiring iu regard to the appointment, expenditure and report of Dr. E. 0. Shakespeare as represent-
ing the United States Cholera Commission, I hav the honor to inform you that a certificate of ap-
pointment was issued by this department on the
1st of October, 1885, to Dr. E. 0. Shakespeare,
designating him as the representative of the
United States to proceed to Spain and other coun-
tries in Europe where cholera existed. On the 5t of October, 1885, and the 12th of January, 1886,
letters of credit on London were issued iu favor of
Dr. Shakespeare for $2,000 and $1,000, respect-
ively, making an aggregate of $3,000. Dr. Shakes-
peare drew the whole of this amount, but has a yet rendered no account of its expenditure. O the 13th of June, 1887, the department wrote to
Dr. Shakespeare expressing regret at the delay i submitting his report on cholera, and hoping tha it would soon be completed and sent. On the
18th of the same month Dr. Shakespeare replied,
sayiug that he hoped to be able to submit his re-
port in two weeks. Since that date nothing ha been heard from him on the subject officially, bu through private letters received from him it ap-
pears that he found great difficulty in having th drawings made of his microscopic studies of mi-
crobes, which would account for the delay in get-
ting out his report.
I have the honor to be, sir,
Your obedient servant,
T. F. Bayard Now in all kindness, we say if Dr Shakespeare failed to see a case of choler in his jauntings through Europe in 1885, or,
seeing, is unable to tell what he did see, le him frankly say so, and refund to the Gov-
ernment the money expended by him Local Boards The Dominion of Canada, with 3,000,000
of square miles and about 6,000,000 of in-
habitants, occupying the extreme norther portion of our continent, is yet very wid awake as to public health. Each Provinc has a board answering to our State Boar of Health; also laws establishing a complet system of local boards, working in complet harmony with the Provincial or State Board The following excerpts from "the Regula-
tions of the Provincial Board of Health fo the Direction of Local Boards of Health o the Province of Quebec" will be read wit interest and profit by our readers who ar trying to get up local boards in their respect-
ive communities The long-continued summers and the fa denser population of Tennessee would re-
quire some of the details below to be altere in the direction of more rigid sanitation:
organization of local boards of health,
their powers and ddtibs.
2. A Local Board of Health will be organize in each municipality of the Province according t clause 6 of the "Act respecting public health
(1888)." Boards of Health or Health Committee previously organized in virtue of article 607 of the
Municipal Code, or of the town corporation's gen-
eral clauses act, or of a special charter, have  legal existence and have the same powers as the
Boards named according to clause 6 of the Act re-
specting public health.
3. Every Local Board must immediately in-
form the Provincial Board, if it has not alread done so, of the names of its members and officer as well as of any change which may take place o its staff.
4. Each municipality will name a Health Offi-
cer, such Health Officer being a licensed physicia whenever possible.
5 Local Boards will promulgate, execute an cause to be executed the regulations and orders o the Provincial Board and any other sanitary laws-
enacted by Provincial or Federal statutes.
6. Local Boards must verify complaints mad to them of bad sanitary conditions in their localit and take such measures as may be thought prope to have them removed, and in cases not provide for in the present regulations, and especially  cities, they shall have power to make the neces-
sary regulations to that effect.
7. By-laws and regulations of Local Boards,
in any way opposed to those of the Provincial
Board, are hereby suspended.
8. The Health Officer or the Secretary of every
Local Board shall, during the month of Januar in each year, send to the secretary of the Provin-
cial Board a report on the work of his Board for

  p. 143 (#317)                       STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
143
the procediug year and on the present sanitar condition of the municipality.
CBMETKRIES.
9. The Local Boards must see that the sanitar requirements of the law respecting interments an disinterments* are obeyed, and inform the Provin-
cial Board of any infractions of the said law s that the Provincial Board may confer with the ec-
clesiastical authorities and the proprietors of ceme-
teries to have the matter remedied.
10. "Whenever the proper authorities shall hav given their permission for the partial or genera removal of dead bodies from a cemetery, it wil be the duty of the Local Board of the municipal-
ity in which such cemetery is situated to prescrib the precautions to be taken, such as disinfection,
etc., so that disinterments may be made withou danger to public health.
11. The Provincial Board having according t law (51-52 Vict., chap. 48) the power to determin what length of time shall elapse between the in-
terment and the disinterment of persons who hav died from cholera, small-pox, typhoid or scarle fever or diphtheria, it will be necessary to obtai its authorization before disinterring such dead per-
sons, even alter live years have elapsed.
PRIVIES, CES8POOLS AND DRAIN'S.
12. The Provincial Board can only tolerat with regret non-cemented privy pits and mos strongly recommends Local Boards to do all i their power to have them replaced by dry-eart closets, or still better by water-closts, when ther is an aqueduct in the locality.
13. No privy vault, cesspool or other reservoi into which a privy, water-closet, sink or stable i drained, except it is water tight, will be permitte within 100 feet of a well, or other source of wate used for drinking or culinary purposes. The
Local Board may determine a greater distance, i the nature of the soil requires it.
14. Privies shall not be tolerated within twent feet of any dwelling-house.
15. Privies and cesspools when full shall b emptied, and all privies and cesspools, whethe full or not, shall be emptied at least once a yea prior to June 1st or after October 1st. Afte emptying, all privies and cesspools shall be disin-
fected.
16. The connection of privy pits with the pub-
lic sewers is not allowed.
17. When a privy pit is to bo abandoned, i must bo first emptied and disinfected, and the filled in with earth well rammed down.
18. No public or private sewer shall empty int any river or other body of water—used for drink-
ing purposes or for ice supply—the capacity o which is not sufficiently large to prevent th water from being contaminated by it, and when-
ever there exists a doubt, the Provincial Boar shall decide the question.
19. All sewage drains that pass within fift feet of any source of water supply for drinking o culinary purposes, shall be water tight, and in por-
ous subsoil the limit shall be 100 feet. The sam rule applies to drains within fifty feet from dwell-
ings.
''An act for the better regulation of interments and dis-
interments. 51-52 Vict., chap. 48.
HOUSEHOLD REFUSE, WASTE MATTERS, GARBAGE,
ETC.
20. No person shall permit the accumulation i or around the immediate vicinity of any dwelling-
house or premises under his control, of refus matter, such as the remains of animals, fish,
vegetables, bones, carcasses or any kind of offa until decomposition sets in. No stagnant wate shall be permitted in places where it can be in-
jurious to health.
21. In localities where the municipality doe not provide for the removal of garbage, ever householder must burn his own refuse (this can b done in the kitchen stove) or bury it at a reason-
able depth. The Local Board may indicate  place for such deposits.
22. The removal of garbage between May 1s and November 15th must be done once a week a least.
23. On the 1st of May of each year every yard,
cellar and surroundings of the house munt hav been cleaned and any noxious animal aud vege-
table matter removed Yellow Fever The editorial from the Cincinnati Lancet-
Clinic is from the pen of Dr. Thomas C Minor, who in 1878 was Health Officer of
Cincinnati, and personally acquainted wit the behavior of yellow fever in the Ohio
Valley. It calls timely attention to a ver prevalent error respecting the scope of ter-
ritory liable to this pestilence, an erro which in more than one instance has bee followed by very costly and fatal conse-
quences Away With Trash The following Nashville city ordinance,
approved Feb. 22, 1889, while prompte by the Fire Department, yet incidentally i a very important contribution to the publi health. It should be adopted by each mu-
nicipal corporation in Tennessee. It make it unlawful to keep, store or allow to remai any waste paper, straw or other rubbis about premises. If faithfully enforced i will add much to the tidy appearance o the alleys and gutters in the business por-
tions of Nashville:
Section 1. That hereafter it shall be unlawfu for any person, firm or corporation to keep, stor or allow to remain any waste paper, straw, shav-
ings or any other inflammable rubbish of any kin in any back yard, alleyway, area, or in any cellar,
store-house, factory or other building within th limits of the city.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Sec. 2. Any straw, excelsior shaving paper o other papers to be used for packing or for manu-
facturing purposes, shall not be allowed to remai or laid loose about on the premises, but shall b either securely packed or baled or kept in som suitable receptacle or place free from danger fro sparks ot other cause of fire Sbc. 3. Any person, firm or corporation havin charge or control of such building or premises re-
ferred to who shall fail to remove or cause to b removed such rubbish or materials referred to i the two preceding sections within twenty-fou hours after having been notified by the Building
Inspector, Chief of the Fire Department or his as-
sistants, or any police officer, shall be deeme guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction there-
of shall be fined not less than $10 nor more than
$50 for each offense, and $10 for each day suc rubbish or materials are allowed to remain there-
after The Lesson of 1878 As in war the famous campaigns of grea leaders, even in far distant ages and coun-
tries, are to-day studied with intense interes by those military officers who aim for suc-
cess and distinction in their high calling, s in the great contest for prolonging th average life of man we must constantl make use of the grand lessons furnished b the experience of the past. Indeed, this i the common-sense mode by which progres is made in all the pursuits of man For Tennessee the most costly, the sad-
dest, and in all respects the most calamitou experience of evil from neglect or ignoranc of sanitary science took place in 1878. T the people of all West Tennessee the scene of that fearful summer and autumn are stil vividly fresh.
J. M. Keating, in his classic "Histor of the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878,"
with conscientious truthfulness portrays th wretchedly unsanitary condition of th wealthy and rapidly growing city of Mem-
phis then and previously. Many smal towns in Tennessee are steadily makin progress to a like miserably filthy state, i due time to reap like harvest—not from yel-
low fever, it is to be hoped—but from othe scourges which annually destroy many mor lives than does the Cuban fiend. Read,
meditate and inwardly digest the subjoine graphic picture In 1879, warned by costly experience,
Memphis commenced a sanitary refor which has given her a wide fame, an which, if persisted in, will in due tim place her not least among the four gran cities laved by the Father of Waters:
The sanitary condition of Memphis was dis-
graceful in the extreme. Miles of Nicholson pave-
ment were decaying and sending forth a poiso that none in the city limits could avoid, and th soil was reoking with the offal and excreta of te thousand families. There was no organized scav-
enger system, no means by which the ashes an garbage could, as it should, be daily carted away The accumulations of forty years were decayin upon the surface; a bayou dividing the city, an which was the receptacle of the contents of privie and water-closets, was sluggish and without cur-
rent, owing to the want of water and the fact tha there had been scarcely any rain for several weeks Dead animals were decaying in many parts of it,
aud the pools which had formed at the abutment of the several bridges wore stagnant and covere with a scum of putridity, emitting a deadl effluvia. The cellars of the houses in the leadin thoroughfares were also alembics, in which wer manufactured noxious gases, which stole out an made the night air an almost killing poison. Th streets were filthy, and every affliction that coul aggravate a disease so cruel, seemed to have bee purposely prepared for it by the criminal neglec of the city government, who turned a deaf year t the persistent appeals of the press. But the were not wholly to blame; the charter unde which they acted was so worded as to provide bu little funds for sanitary relief, and no relief in cas of the dreadful emergency of an epidemic, not-
withstanding 1867 and 1873. Every interest wa carefully guarded and provided for save that o the health and lives of the people. They mus either take care of themselves—that is. be pre-
pared to abandon their homes when yellow feve or cholera made its appearance—or be ready t meet death. Ignorant of the laws of life, it framers denied to themselves and their fellow-
citizens the advantages of a growing intelligenc in regard to sanitary affairs Disinfecting Establishments in Germany In the last year's meeting of the German PnWic
Health Association, the following resolutions wit reference to disinfecting establishments wer passed:
Each large city should have one or more publi disinfecting stations. For the general use of th public in small towns, transportable disinfectin apparatuses are preferable The use of public disinfecting establishment should bo available to the poor without pay whe their need is certified by the attending physician For purposes of disinfecting, "streaming steam"
(stromede Dampfe) is preferable Tbe choice of the apparatus, and the technica arrangemeut of it, will depend upon the local con-
ditions In connection with tbe disinfecting establish-
ment, it would be advantageous to have a bathin establishment.—Sanitary Inspector, Maine.

The Yellow Fever Outlook for Next
Summer The unusually mild winter noted in all section of the country, taken in connection with the fac that yellow fever still lingers in the tropics, is suf-
ficent to cause a marked feeling of uneasines among the sanitary authorities of the South and
Southwest. Similar meteorological condition were manifest prior to the outbreak of 1878, an there is reason to think that history may repeat it-
self. Yellow fever, even although of an importe type, with the death of a Lieutenant on board o the Yantic in New York harbor on the 14th of Jan-
uary, is enough to cause comment, if not alarm Should the present balmy weather continue int spring, the month of June will most probably ex-
hibit a yellow fever tendency in the Gulf States,
especially in Florida Within the last ten years the railroads and steam-
boats have opened up large additional tracts o territory in the New South; numerous towns hav sprungup, filled with unacclimated Northern me-
chanics, who are not suitable subjects for exposur to the low forms of paludal fevers which annuall prevail in many districts south of Kentucky and
Tennessee. Kapid transit means the swift, sprea of infectious and contagious diseases. It then be-
hooves the various railroad and steamboat interest of the Southwest to settle on some fixed sanitar policy; there are millions of dollars of interests a stake, and it is penny wise and pound foolish t subject such interests to a shotgun-quarantin policy; yet this is what may naturally be expecte every time an outbreak of yellow fever occurs i all States lying below the Appalachian Ridge Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and rail-
road corporations, including sleeping car interests,
should have learned by experience, dearly bought,
that they will not be trusted by those peopl through whose territory they carry infected pas-
sengers so long as the inhabitants know that suc work is not done under medical supervision If the interests of the corporation are to be pro-
tected with those of the individual, co-operatio between railroad and steamboat companies an local sanitary boards will be necessary. Th earlier this is done the presens year the better One case of yellow fever in New Orleans or Jack-
sonville, in June, means an epidemic at Memphis,
Chattanooga and Birmingham in August It is folly to suppose that yellow fever will no spread north of the Ohio River. New York, Phil-
adelphia, and Bostou have been scourged in time past; Louisville, Cincinnati, anil Gallipolis hav had indigenous cases within the last ten years. I is only the fine sanitary work done hy the New
York City Health Department annually that Weep fever out of that port; their work of isolation i more of a protection than the boasted quarantin work of their State authorities After New York. Chicago does the best sanitar work in the country, ami Chicago watches yello fever in Florida, although it is far enough north t be almost beyond the range of epidemic probabili-
ties. As the Eastern States owe a debt of grati-
tude to New York City's Health Department, so d the Northwestern Stales owe the Chicago healt authorities a bounty of praises, for were it not fo their emigrant inspection, Iowa. Wisconsin, Min-
nesota, and other States would suffer from small-
pox. There are able sanitarians in New Orleans,
Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta and Savannah—me who have had executive experience in the manage-
ment of past epidemics The country at large would save millions of dol-
lars annually wore it not subjected to the senseles oxcitements inducod by yellow fever outbreaks If we lived under a more paternal form of govern-
ment, with a centralized power, much could be ac-
complished in the prevention of epidemics; bu the glorious old doctrine of State rights, more de-
fiant than ever, prevails to an alarming extent,
North and South. To meet the requirements o the case, the State Boards of Health must joi forces and act in harmony, for the State Health
Officer of Tennessee must not think differentl from the State Health Officer of Louisiana i matters pertaining to the sanitary inter-state reg-
ulation of the passenger and freight traffic of for-
eign corporations As we before remarked, "It is a warm winter."
With Jacksonville still in sight and to the memor of many dear, yellow fever on the Yantic in New
York harbor, with a death in the middle of Janu-
ary, the outlook for yellow fever next summer i good; alarm is needless, but the warning is give to those most concerned for their best interests.—

elm trees in full bloom, and plum trees budding Sergt. J. B. Marbury, U. S. Observer at Nash-
ville, furnishes the following notes for the month:
"The general conditions of the atmosphere fo the month were, in some respects, different fro the average, viz.: The mean temperature, 36°,
was about nine degrees below the normal for th past 16 years, while the barometric pressure wa slightly in excess of the average; the amount o precipitation was very low."
The Observer at Andersonville reports the fol-
lowing: ''The rain on the night of the 18th wa the severest ever known hereabouts. The aggre-
gate rainfall for the night was not very unusual,
but between 12 and 1 o'clock it came down in  perfect sluice. The high branches washed ou fences never before moved by water. Even th woods in many places were swept bare of leave over the whole surface. The earth appeared t have been literally covered with running water Mnch damage was done in washing the land an washing away the fencing. Lightning struck an ignited and entirely destroyed a hay stack nea this place. The thunder during the nights of the
17th and 18th was particularly heavy The Observer at Parksville makes the followin note: "A beautiful month. We had had, we weather from the 13th to the 19th. The water were high on the 16th. Farmers have had severa good, dry days in which to plow."
The Observer at Riddleton says: "Februar was a most disagreeable month—very few day that were clear all day."
The Observer at Florence Station says: "Th soil was very cold throughout the month—no until the 26th was it warm enough to bring u oats."
The Observer at Lawrenccburg makes the fol-
lowing notes: "The rainy season of the 14th-
17th closed with a remarkable display of celestia pyrotechnics. At 8 p. m. the whole sky was over-
cast with an apparently homogeneous mass o cloud. Peals of thunder from the southern quarte indicated the existence in that region of a thunde cloud, which was concealed by the underlyin mass, while the flashes of lightning rendered th sky one almost continuous blaze of light."
Sergt. Pindell, U. S. Observer at Chattanooga,
reports the rainfall at stations outside the State a follows: Murphy, N. C, 5.71 inches; Charleston,
N. C, 3.80 iuches, and snowfall 2.80 inches;
Asheville, N. C, 1.42 inch The following is the January report for Ander-
sonville Station, which was received too late fo insertion: Mean temperature, 38° 8; mean o maximum temperature, 45^.5; mean of minimu temperature, 33°.0; highest temperature, 60°, o the 17th; lowest temperature, 20°, on the 22d;
range, 40°; mean daily range, 13°.6; total rain-
fall, 2.19 inches; mean daily rainfall, 0.071 inch;
greatest rainfall in 24 consecutive hours, 1.10 inch,
on the 27th; snowfall, trace on the 9th and 28th;
clear days, 11; fair days 6; cloudy days, 14 ; day on which 0.01 rain fell, 3; solar halos, 1st, 11th;
fogs, 7th, 17; prevailing wind, southwest The thunderstorm of the night of the 16th at
Nashville was the occasion of one of the most re-
markably displays of electricity ever witnessed a this place. From 9 p. m. to midnight a ver heavy cloud passed to the north of the city, wit vivid lightning and heavy thunder. At midnigh another cloud passed from the southwest to th southeast with incessant lightning, diffuse an zigzag, and a continuous roll of thunder. Thi storm center passed about fifty miles south ol
Nashville, aud was accompanied with one of th heaviest rains ever known in the section ove which it passed. One of the bridges on the
Louisville and Nashville railroad in Maury count was washed away, causing much delay and incon-
venience in the regular running of trains. A
great deal of damage was done to fencing by th sudden rise of the streams. This storm was fol-
lowed by a cold wave With this report appears the first report of Dr.
A. Slack, the Observer in charge of the now statio at Cog Hill, McMinn county. This is an im-
portant point in the Eastern division, and promise to show good results in the collection of data In the transfer of Sergt. L. N. Jesnnofsky, fo many years U. S. Observer in charge of the Nash-
ville station, the service in the State loses a valua-
ble and faithful officer. Much of the success o the service in Tennessee during the past six year is due to the prompt and cheerful co-operation of
Sergt. Jesunofsky, and it is safe to say that th best wishes of his many friends in Tennessee g with him to his new field of usefulness in New
York City. Sergt. Jesunofsky is succeeded by
Sergt. J. B. Marbury, who has already given evi-
dence of being worthy to occupy the place left b his predecessor It is to be regretted that several of the voluntar observers have failed to send in their February re-
ports in time for insertion.

J>r. J. D. Plunket, President State Board 0/ Health:
Sir—At the quarterly meeting of this Board,
held January 8th and 9th, attention was called t the great necessity of radical improvements in the
State House—commonly called the Capitol, i imitation of imperial Rome, though the good old
English term is far preferable, as being more dem-
ocratic and raoro significant of the real uses t which said building is applied. For a truth, it i the dwelling house of the State of Tennessee,
wherein the legislative, executive and suprem judiciary all meet and work for the good of th grand old Commonwealth After full deliberation the Board unanimousl adopted the following resolution:
Sesolred, That the attention of the General
Assembly be called to the prest-ing necessity o improving the sanitary condition of the Capitol b systematic ventilation, heating and drainage o the building upon the most improved plans, a may be indicated after a careful survey shall hav been made by experts The Secretary was directed to transmit th same to the Speaker of the Senate and the Speake of the House, with an appropriate letter Accordingly, on January 14th, the communica-
tion subjoined was sent in as directed:
Office State Board ok Health,
Nashville, Tenn., January 14, 1889 Hon. B. J. Lea, Speaker of the Senate:
Sir—I am directed by the State Board of Hoalt to send you a copy of a resolution unanimousl adopted by said Board, at its meeting on January
9th, to-wit:
"Revolted, That the attention of the General
Assembly be called to the pressing necessity o improving the sanitary condition of the Capitol b systematic ventilation, heating and drainage o the building upon the most improved plans, a may be indicated after a careful survey shall hav been made by experts."
Allow mo to add that, inasmuch as the Asylu for the Insane near Enoxvillo was furnished a yea or so ago with most complete apparatus for heat-
ing and ventilation, and the one now nearly com-
pleted at Bolivar is a model in these respects,
there can be no difficulty m securing plans an estimates from experts whose work is already wel known and tested in Tennessee Very respectfully,
J. Berrien Lindsley,

port (which will be found elsewhere in this num-
ber) by the Executive Committee as representin the Board, which was transmitted to tho Speaker of each House The fact that the present General Assembly ha been called upon to make large appropriations fo buildings and objects that cannot brook delay,
and also tho fact that tho State has been com-
pelled to borrow money to meet interest due on it funded debt, sufficiently account for delay i carrying out the recommendations of this Boar at the present time There can lie no doubt that the Forty-Seventh
General Assembly will see to it that a State llous which, with its appurtenances, could not be re"
placed for one and a half million of dollars, an which is universally conceded to be one of th handsomest in the grand Union of forty-two
States, shall not go to ruin and remain unfit fo lack of a few thousand dollars The following additions have been made to the

Secretary Dr. Plunket, delegate to the Quarantine
Conference recently held at Montgomery,
presented a very full report of that conven-
tion, which was listened to with much inter-
est by the members, and it brought up fo consideration the subject of quarantine i general and inland quarantine in particular,
and led to a thorough review of the method adopted heretofore in the South, especiall those of last summer On motion of Judge Hadden the repor was received and ordered printed, wit thanks to the reporter. (See page 157 o this Bulletin.)
Dr. Plunket presented a report upon hi investigation on March 8th, in Decatur,
Ala., of the rumored "suspicious case" o yellow fever, with death, of Roberta John-
ston at that point in February last. A this report has already been widely printe in the newspapers it was received an ordered filed The Board adjourned until 3 o'clock, a which hour it reassembled Dr. Plunket, chairman of Committee on
Legislation, reported that he had succeede in getting the vital statistics bill through the
Senate. The members of the Board al hoped that the House would make it a law The water supply of several cities wa discussed, and examinations will be mad at an early date of the artesian wells of
Memphis, which have attracted great atten-
tion throughout the United States From statements made by the member of the Board it was evident that interest i sanitary work is very much on the increas in Tennessee, and also that the efforts o the Board are very much appreciated After examining and approving accounts,
the Board adjourned to meet on Tuesday,
July 2, 1889 Report to the Legislature on the Needs o the Capitol Building, by State
Board of Health Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, Tenn., March 15, 1889 To the Forty-Sixth General Assembly of the Stat of Tennessee:
Sirs—In compliance with the following HouBe
Joint Resolution No. 68, concurred in by tho Sen-
ate on March 12th:
"licit resolved by the General Assembly of the
State of Tennessee, That the State Board of Healt he requested to investigate the sanitary conditio of the Capitol and report to the General Assembl at its earliest convenience the most approved pla for tho systematic ventilation, heating and drain-
age of tho building, with estimates of cost of th same, and for this purpose they may, if they dee it necessary, have a careful survey made by com-
petent experts, the cost of which shall be provide for in the general appropriation bill Resolved further, That a copy of this resolutio be furnished the President or Secretary of the
State Board of Health.
"Adopted February 19, 1889."
The State Board of Health would report tha there are three principal sanitary defects in the
Capitol building, any one of which may seriously

damage the health of persons occupying sai bmlding, even for a short time The water-closets are so situated and so con-
structed as to draw up foul sewer gases from th largo extent of drain pipes between the buildin and Lick branch. These foul emanations fro sewers are universally regarded as most insidiou and dangerous poisons At times the atmosphere of the whole lowe corridors are permeated with such deleteriou gases The present mode of heating the Capitol is  mere makeshift, long since banished from all pub-
lic buildings. With stoves and fire-places it i impossible to heat the offices, corridors and legis-
lative halls with any degree of uniformity As to ventilation, during that portion of th year in which the building is most used, there i simply none—consequently legislators, jurists an other officials while engaged in the performance o duty are breathing an unwholesome atmosphere,
which tends to incapacitate them fur calm, health-
ful thought During the past thirty years, both in Europe an the United States, many and costly experiment have been made in order to relieve public build-
ings, especially city balls, capitols and charitabl institutions, from the great ills growing out of de-
fective drainage, heating and ventilation. Thes have finally ended in one result, to-wit, the estab-
lishment of a plant by which these buildings ar artificially ventilated, heated by hot air, steam o hot water, and foul gases effectually expelled While the language of the resolution unde which this report is made does not specificall embrace the idea of decay which is to be see going on in so many parts of tho building, yet t omit a reference to it in this connection would, i the opinion of the State Board of Health, be bu little less than culpable The extent of this decay we feel sure is mor serious and widespread than is generally known,
aud in some portions of the structure has by neg-
lect become so urgent as now not to admit o longer delay in having the necessary attentio given it That you may have full aud reliable data i this regard, will say that we have had made  careful inspection of the entire structure by on eminently qualified for such work, and submit fo your earnest consideration the following extract taken from his report upon tho subject:
"In the first place as regards tho approaches All the stone ontsido shows more or less evi-
dence of decay, many of the steps and curbin having been badly broken and rapidly going t pifces It is not of very much importance in the isolate steps, but those which are in flights will shortly b in ruins if something is not done to protectthem The terrace around the outside <>1 the building-
contains a number ot cisterns. The stone of whic it is built is all laminated, and we found by sound-
ing them with a cane that fully ten per cent, o them wore split through and through by the actio of tho frost The action of the water from the cisterns on th inside with the action of the weather will ver soon make all the terrace a wreck. Prompt actio could save this terrace, but if it is delayed even  short time longer it will require to lie renewe from the beginning. Wo would recommend tha a covering be placed over it which would exclud the water from the t«>p If this was done in dry weather it is more tha likely that a large portion of the frost actio would cease Immediately over the grand stairway, from th office floor up, there is an arch spanning its ful width We were unable to reach this arch to determin whether it was of brick or stone. It is badl broken at both ends, and if of heavy material, a we presume it is, and not sustained by an iro beam, is in imminent danger of falling.
I should say that there could be no justificatio for not taking immediate steps to ascertain its ma-
terial, aud if of brick or stone it idionld bo re-
moved at once The entrance to the water-closets, with th present absence of any systematic exhaust of fou air from the building, shows very large evidence o tho increased action of ammoniacal salts, due t the presence of the foul air on the walls of th passages loading to it, many of them being cov-
ered with a fine dust of disintegrated stone. Thi action is going on throughout the building, but i more particularly marked there because it is mor rapid there than elsewhere The condensation of water on the bare ston walls of the interior is doing an immense amoun of mischief In many places the writer noticed puddles o water which form there from the dripping of con-
densed water from the walls This water, washing down as it does, the wslls>
already foul by exposure to tho bad air of th building, and having been condensed from ai which is probably already exhausted, contains  large proportion of deleterious element to a ston of this character Unless some means is taken to get rid of thi actiou, there is no saying how soon the iuterior o the building will bo in as bad condition as the ex-
terior The writer also noticed some curious actiou o settlement probably in the piers of the dome There are a number of cracked stones in thes piers. Tho northeast and northwest piers contai respectively thirteen and sixteen cracked stones,
while the southwest and southeast contain respec-
tively four and two. These cracks generally see to follow about the lines that would occur wher stono has not been well bedded and is very heavil loaded There is, however, a locality in which evidenc of settlement is unquestionable, the anionnt whic tho stone work has moved being perceptible. That,
is near tho northwest pier, along tho wall joinin it to the northwest wait.

I am unable to account for this settlement,
vhich seems to be only vuible here and at the ex-
treme north end of the building, unless it is tha mime of the exposed limestone underneath, upo which the building is founded, have the under-
lined strata of marl washed out of them, and th settlement is taking place on this account.
1 do not advance this as a filed opinion.
A further evidence of this settlement is given i the fact that there are two broken steps in th grand stairway where it turns from the first fligh to go to the second flight There are also two broken flag stones. I do no think either one can fall at present, althoug further cracking might possibly cause their fall,
and the fall of thU or any other portion migh valise the death of one or more of the valuabl citizens of Tennessee On examination of the outside of the buildin we find on the north end that every lintel an pilaster is broken The liutels are uniforml made of three pieces of stone, two set on edge t form tho in.-ide and outside faces, and the thir filling the space between them. Many of thes are broken in several places. We believe tha this is duo to lnut action, brought about in th following way: The floors of the porticos of th building are entirely uncovered. Water seepin through them will necessarily saturate the wall upon which they rest, and will filter down to th depths of the pilasters. Having been wetted i this way tlnir fracture by frost is a very simpl matter There is further evidence of trouble also at thi point apart from the fracture above mentioned That, is to say, that there are two causes of frac-
ture existing at this point—ono from frost on ac-
count of the infiltration of water through th stones, which falls upon the main portico, an the other due to some settlement which we can-
not account for Our opinion as to frost action is confirmed b the fact that on the south entrance there are n broken lintels, while on the east and west ther are only a very few—probably three would cove the number in the two porticoes This could be materially protected by coverin the porticoes with some impervious covering so a to stop tho infiltration of water there.
l''or example, they might be covered with shee copper iu such a way as to permit of their bein freidy walked on, and yet form a perfectly imper-
vious covering We forgot to note ono fact in connection wit this, which is, that the plastering on the east en of the arch under tho main portico, which is  brick arch covered with plaster, has begun to fal away and show evidence of the character of deca which takes place in a wet wall The entire outside of the building is built o stone of a very inferior quality, and tho most vig-
orous action is necessary to prevent the deca which is now so disfiguring and apparent fro going so far as to render what is probably th most beautiful example of classic architecture i the United States a ruin It is difficult to say how long it would bo befor this building would become a ruin, but it is certai that tho time, unless something is done, is limited,
and that great difficulty will be experienced i meeting inquiries as to why proper steps were no taken for its protection As regards remedies, it would he possible t plaster the entire stone interior of the buildin without disfiguring in such a way as to stop th condensation of water, except on the palistor which have capitols It would be necessary in this case to do som additional work before plastering Of course the pla»tering should he applied wit an air chamber between it and the stone We consider that it is necessary that the build-
ing should bo veneered with either marble or som other durable stone for its protection. Say veneer-
ing was applied by cutting away the stone an bolting a flush stone to it, so as to give an entirel new surface out and out. It will doubtless see that this is a heroic measure, but we know of n instance in which a stone radically inferior ha been saved by means of the preservatives whic are ordinarily applied We therefore consider that tho shortost an most effective way to handle it would be to pro-
tect the stone entirely by exposing an entirel new surface to the atmosphere, composed of ston which is known to stand its effect*."
At the request of the State Board of Health
Mr. H. 1*. McDonald, an expert in the employ o tho Commissioners of the West Tennessee Asylu for the Insane, furnished the enclosed estimate and preliminary plans, which are hereunto attache and adopted as part of this report, and are recom-
mended to the favorable consideration of you honorable body All of which is respectfully submitted.

Health, Xashville, Tenn.:
Dear Sir—In accordance with our intervie had tnis morning I submit the following in refer-
ence to heating and ventilating the Capitol build-
ing, it being understood that the figures given ar approximate, and will be possibly subject to con-
siderable modification, and I have taken care t assume my data sufficiently large to insure tha the cost of execution will come under, rather tha over the amount hereinafter stated. The buildin embraces a cubic content of one million an ninety-one thousand cubic feet, in which the ai must be renewed entirely every hour and fresh ai furnished at a suitable temperature in order t insure perfect ventilation To insure this result there would be required  duct capable of carrying fifty-five cubic feet of ai per lineal foot of its section at the rate of six fee per second, or two and a half miles per hour This rate of flow will bo proserved throughou tho system, and will insure that no objections du to draughts, either of cold or warm air, can arise Tho above stated amount of warm air being intro-
duced into the building, a similar amount mus ho evacuated from it One million cubic feet of air will weigh, approx-
imately, at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, 72.000 pounds,
and this must be lifted through an average heigh of 70 feet, amounting to 5,340,000 foot pounds o work to be accomplished per hour, without con-
sidering loss from friction or curvature.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Liberal allowance for these will indicate that a
12-horse engine could accomplish the work of in-
spiration. A similar engine must be furnished t perforin the work of expiration. A 25 - hors power engine could therefore, under all circum-
stances, perform the necessary service To warm 1,000,000 cubic leet of air there wil be required a steam main of 109 inches section,
and there would be about 11,000 feet of radiatin surface necessary There would be consumed one pound of coal fo every 6,000 feet of air warmed to a difference of
70 degrees between the inside and outside tempera-
tures, or a maximum of 2.000 pouuds of coal pe day.
I have thought it advisable, in view of tho fac that if the apparatus were placed within the build-
ing, a smoke-stack must be erected somewher within it, to make an estimate of cost of placin the entire plant on a separate lot, reaching it b means of underground ducts for both inspiratio and expiration, placing there the boilers, engine and fans. It would be necessary, under this sys-
tem, to distribute in the basement of the buildin the warmed air through a svsteni of pipes whic would lead to the various rising ducts, and by th introduction of false partitions in the recesses o the walls in the first story, to form ducts for th delivery of fresh air, and the abstraction of fou air to the second story. Were it decided that th stack mentioned would not sufficiently mar th appearance of the building to prevent, and i therefore were placed inside, a very considerabl reduction could be made. The entire cost of th apparatus first described would possibly amount to
$32,400, including plumbers' work, which I shal hereafter describe; were it decided lo place th boilers within the building and erect the stack als within it, a difference in cost of something like
$9,000 could be made, making the total cost o heating, plumbing and ventilation $2:5,400 1 be-
lieve it practicable to place the boilers within th building and get rid of the smoke by means of a underground duct, discharging at some point dis-
tant from the building, and so located as to avoi annoyance to the property of persons living nea by. I have not, however, at present the data fo such a step so clearly in my mind as to justify m in submitting an estimate of cost, although I a of opinion that $1,500 added to the $23,400 abov mentioned would probably cover it. In consider-
ing this idea it must be borne in mind that the ap-
pearance of a flue discharging smoke out of th ground without visible cause is to be taken int careful consideration before a project involving it use would be adopted.
I have not included in the estimate above give the purchase of the ground necessary upon whic to locate the plant above described In regard to the plumbers' work, there should b a lavatory provided on both the first and secon floors for both ladies and gentlemen. My estimat has included performing this work in a satisfactor and suitable manner to suit the style of the build-
ing in which it is to be placed. I feel safe in say-
ing that the problem in question can be brought t a successful solution within the sum stated above,
and possibly very far within it, although, in orde to insure satisfactory results, I would recommen that a properly constituted committee be author-
ized to expend, if necessary, up to tho full amount There is no ventilating apparatus in use in thi country with which the writer is familiar that ca be expected to give better results than the on estimated for in this paper, and I feel safe in say-
ing that the extremes in difference of temperatur will not be more at any point, except immediatel at the entrance, than five degrees With the exhaust system above mentioned i use tho avoidance of the discharge of foul air fro the city sewers becomes a matter of the greates simplicity, and, without going into details, I wil say that the sewer gas can be entirely eliminate from the building. I will also remark that no
"gravity" or "natural" system can be relie upon to work satisfactorily in unpropitiou weather, and that nothing will secure positive re-
sults except a power which can be relied on i all weathers, as steam can be, for which I hav herein estimated.
I have the honor to be, with great respect Tours, etc.,

rine Hospital Service; Georgia, 11; Flor-
ida, 9; Louisiana, 5; South Carolina, 2;
North Carolina, 5; Illinois, 3; Kentucky,
4; Texas, 2; Mississippi, 4; Tennessee,
4; with the following visitors: Drs. George
M. Sternberg, Surgeon U. S. A.; Victor C Vaughan, member State Board of Healt of Michigan; George Homan, Secretary
State Board of Health of Missouri; W. C Van Bibber, of Maryland, and D. M. Bur-
gess, of Havana, Cuba. The delegate from Tennessee were Hon. David Park
Hadden, Drs. G. B. Thornton and J. E Black, from Memphis, and myself, and i the permanent organization of the Confer-
ence, Tennessee was complimented by se-
lecting Hon. D. P. Hadden for one of its
Vice Presidents—there being one from each
State represented After a brief, earnest and sincere greetin from his Excellency Gov. Thomas Seay, the
President, Dr. C. P. Wilkinson, of Louisiana,
declared the meeting ready for business,
and appointed two committees of twelv each, one "On Papers and Resolutions,"
upon which Tennessee was represented by
Dr. G. B. Thornton, and one "On Busi-
ness," upon which your reporter served The first paper read was upon "Maritime
Quarantine Services of the Southern Sea-
ports," by Dr. C. P. Wilkinson, the now
President of the Louisiana State Board of
Health, and successor of the distinguished
Holt. Dr. Wilkinson is about 35 years old,
has a cool, clear head, firm and decidedl practical, and seems to realize fully the re-
sponsibilities of his office and its relation t the millions of people inhabiting the Missis-
sippi Valley. This much I have thought i necessary to say for your information abou the man who now stands sanitary guard a the mouth of the Mississippi River. Th paper read by him was full of detail of th methods pursued at the quarantine statio below New Orleans, which are those know as the "Holt system," except in place o the wooden cylinders heretofore used fo heating purposes iron ones are to be substi-
tuted. He emphasized the importance an desirability of having a similarly equippe station at all the large ports in the United
States upon the Gulf, and also those of
Central and South America During the discussion of the paper whic followed it was suggested by Dr. George M Sternberg, Surgeon U. S. A., that where i becomes necessary in the interior of th country to apply the principles of the
Louisiana system, a locomotive could con-
veniently be used to supply the steam Surgeon General Hamilton, M. H. S.,
stated that he was of the opinion that the
Government ought to construct cars wit steel chambers with super-heated steam gen-
erators, so that they could be moved fro place to place, as the exigencies of the hou demanded. Such plans had already bee filed at Government headquarters, and h hoped to have the cars ready in case the should be needed during the approachin summer The following resolution was unanimousl adopted:
Resolved, That this conference endorse the
Holt quarantine and disinfection system, a at present operated in New Orleans, as th best one known for the prevention of th introduction of yellow fever into the port of the United States, and recommend it uniform adoption The Conference was a very industriou assembly, and even if it had had an oppor-
tunity extended it by the citizens of Mont-
gomery of meeting socially her people, i could not have done so without suspendin a rule, which was early adopted, of holding,
each day, a morning, afternoon and nigh session An interesting paper was read by Col. J.
C. Clark on "Railroad Quarantine." Thi was a practical paper, from a very practica man, and one who, as manager of railroads,
has had large experience during the pas fifteen years with inland quarantines.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN He urged the importance of all inlan quarantines being under the sole control of
State Boards of Health, and thought th maritime quarantine should be managed b the general Government The following sixteen propositions pro-
posed by the "Committee on Business" fo discussion were taken up separately an considered seriatim:
Question I. What form of notificatio shall be adopted in case of occurrence o yellow fever? To whom shall the first noti-
fication be sent?
Dr. G. B. Thornton offered the following:
Resolved, Tliat this Conference urges upo all health authorities of States represente in it the importance of strict complianc with the agreement of interstate notificatio adopted by the National Conference of
State Boards of Health and the Sanitary
Council of the Mississippi Valley, in regar to all communicable diseases, and especiall in regard to yellow fever After being amended so that notificatio shall also be sent to the Surgeon General o the Marine Hospital Service, it was adopted Ques. 2. Under what circumstance should an epidemic be declared to exist?
After discussion by several this was, upo motion, tabled Qucs. j. Should we advise depopulatio in the event of the appearance of yello fever in any place, and if so, how soon?
The following was adopted as the sens of the Conference:
In the beginning of an outbreak of yello fever there is no need of depopulation a all, except of infected houses, or infecte districts; but if people who are able t afford the expense desire to leave they shoul do so quietly and deliberately, and no ob-
stacles should be placed in their way; an those who leave healthy districts of the cit or town should go wherever they please,
without let or hindrance Persons living in infected houses, or i infected districts, should be encouraged t leave, but should be allowed to leave onl under such restrictions as will afford reason-
able guarantees of safety to the communi-
ties in which they find asylum; and the should be sent only to such communities a are willing to receive them In the depopulation of infected houses o of special infected districts, the inhabitant should be removed into camps of probation,
or into vacant houses in the adjacent coun-
try. After ten days' detention, if they re-
main well, and under proper regulations,
such as disinfection of baggage, they shoul be considered free from danger, and allowe to go freely into any community willing t receive them Quts. 4. Is it practicable to cause depop-
ulation of large cities?
Tabled Ques. 5. Are probation camps desirable?
By'whom should they be managed and sup-
ported?
Tabled Ques. 6. On the occurrence of a case o yellow fever, what immediate measures o isolation are desirable?
Substitute adopted Ques. 7. What means of disinfectio should be adopted for chambers and dwell-
ings where cases of yellow fever have oc-
curred?
During the discussion of this proposition
Hon. D. P. Hadden arose in his seat an said: "Directly in connection with the sub-
ject under consideration he desired, in ac-
cordance with instructions given him a chairman of a committee appointed by the
Sanitary Council of the Mississippi Valley,
to present a resolution, which had bee unanimously adopted by that body, and as the concurrence of the Conference regardin it, which motion he would now make."
The resolution was as follows:
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Sani-
tary Council of the Mississippi Valley that
Decatur, Ala., under existing circumstances,
should, without delay, be thoroughly disin-
fected and otheiwise placed in the best sani-
tary condition, and that the proper authori-
ties, either State or local, are respectfully

■urged to see that the same is done imme-
diately Dr. Jerome Cochrane, State Health office of Alabama, sprang at once to his feet, an said "that it would be useless adopting thi resolution, for he would assure the confer-
ence that no such thing would be done. H knew that not a single germ of yellow feve still existed in Decatur; he knew it. The
State of Alabama had the money to do th work asked for, and he had control of it,
but he would cut off his right hand befor he would do this work."
Mayor Austin, of Decatur, followed in a earnest, strong statement of the grievance of that city in regard to the inattention o the Alabama State Health officer to the pe-
tition of his people for a thorough disinfec-
tion of D'-catur. Not one of the man speakers who followed in the discussion o this resolution expressed the slightest doub of its importance or necessity, but the ten-
dency was decidedly to drift away from th subject matter of the resolution, and instead,
substitute a personal one. With this view,
the Conference voted to lay the resolutio upon the table, when, if a vote could hav been had direct upon the original proposi-
tion, it would jnquestionably have bee adopted by a large majority Ques. 8. What system of disinfectio should be adopted for the disinfection o personal baggage of persons fleeing from a infected place?
A motion was adopted that moist heat i the best known disinfectant Ques. p. Health certificates Ques. 10. When refugees may return Ques. ii. Hibernation; indefinitely post-
poned Ques. 12. Shotgun quarantines are barbar-
ous and discreditable to our civilization All quarantines should be under the con-
trol of experts Ques. ij. During the prevalence of yel-
low fever epidemics, passengers and freight should be brought from infected localitie only under such regulations and restriction as may be established by the State healt authorilies along the lines of the roads con-
cerned Ques. 14. The passage of railroad train should he allowed, without obstruction, eve when carrying sick refugees from infecte places to healthy localities willing to receiv them Ques. 15. Quarantine inspectors on rail-
road trains should be under the control o the health authorities of the several States,
rather than under the control of the healt authorities of the communities scattere along the line of the road. In this wa quarantine regulations may be enforce with the smallest amount of friction an inconvenience to the traveling public,
and with the maximum of efficiency an economy. At the same time the wishes o the local authorities should be treated wit all due consideration Ques. 16. Local quarantines, that is t say, the separate quarantine of towns an counties, should, as far as circumstance will warrant, be superseded by State quar-
antines, and this on the ground alike o economy, efficiency and convenience The "Committee on Papers," in their re-
port upon Col. J. C. Clark's paper, sub-
mitted a series of propositions suggested b the paper, which were found similar in thei significance and practically were embrace in those suggested by the "Committee on
Business," as they appear above. Much in-
teresting and profitable discussion was ha upon these several propositions, and tha the views of the Conference might be ac-
curately reported a committee of eleve was appointed to take charge of the differ-
ent propositions considered; and draft  code of rules and regulations in accordanc with the views expressed by the Conference,
to be recommended to the different healt organizations in the several States repre-
sented in the Conference for adoption That there might also be no conflict o opinion as held by the Conference upon th points at issue and the Sanitary Council o the Mississippi Valley, time was given thi committee in which to confer with th executive committee of the Council, and,
as far as possible, agree upon a set of uni-
form rules and regulations to be observed i the conduct of all inland quarantines here-

after. These will appear in the publishe proceedings of the Conference, which wil soon be issued, copies of which will be for-
warded to this Board Dr. W. C. Van Bibber, of Baltimore,
read an interesting paper upon "The Quar-
antine of the Future." He said it woul resemble much the modern fire departmen of a great city, a thoroughly organized de-
partment, with experienced chiefs, improve apparatus and thorough drill. The fir alarm now scarcely causes a ripple of ex-
citement. So it would be in time of epi-
demic, for the people would then know an feel that with such a health service, what-
ever can be done will be done, as the whol business would be in the hands of thos most competent to manage it Dr. D. M. Burgess, a resident of Havana,
Cuba, for the past twenty-five years, an who is now attached to the United States
Consulate at that place as medical inspector,
read a very interesting paper upon "The
Sanitary Inspection Service at Havana,
Island of Cuba." He dwelt with muc emphasis upon the careless manner in whic health certificates are issued by the Cuba authorities to ships and sailors coming t the United States ports. He said the great-
est danger of the introduction of yello fever into this country from Cuba was b means of smuggling schooners carrying o their illegal traffic between that island and
Florida The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treas-
ury of the United States is hereby requeste to increase the patrol service of the coast of
Florida to such an extent as may be neces-
sary to prevent smuggling Two very able and instructive lecture were delivered before the conference, on upon " Hunting Yellow Fever Germs," by
Dr. G. M. Sternberg, Surgeon U. S. A.,
and the leading bacteriologist of this country,
and the other upon "Ptomaines, or the
Poisons Generated by Fever Germs," by
Dr. V. C. Vaughan, member of the State
Board of Health of Michigan, and Pro-
fessor of Chemistry in the University at Ann
Arbor During the noon recess upon the secon day the attention of the members of the
Conference was called to the merits of  cremation furnace which is now in use i quite a number of places in this country,
and as a number of towns in Tennesse would find it to their advantage to look into-
this matter, I will simply add a word upo this one, a model of which was exhibited The problem of constructing a furnace mod-
erate in cost, economical in fuel, capable o destroying quickly all varieties of wast matter, with practical freedom from noxiou smoke and gases while in operation, and a the same time afford a product which wil be remunerative for fertilizing uses, is t realize what has been until recently only-
ideal This, it is claimed by "The Engle Sani-
tary and Cremation Company of DesMoines.
and New York," they can do, and the propose to submit estimates for the erec-
tion of furnaces at any place, large o small, and put same into active operation,
with payment conditional upon satisfactory-
performance. Nashville might find, upo investigation, one or two of these furnace much more economical and satisfactory tha the expensive sewers she is now constructin under great difficulty and by piecemeal Clippings from the Montgomery Adver-
tiserand Dispatch are herewith appended fo fuller detail of the proceedings of the Con-
ference All of which is respectfully submitted.
J. D. Plunket The Florida Board of Health At last! At last Florida has a Hoard of Health,
or will have as soon as the Governor can appoin it. The special session of the Legislature, calle to form a board, has succeeded in its mission, an the Governor lias signed the act This act calls for the appointment by the Gov-
ernor, within thirty days, of a hoard to consist o three members; this body will meet immediately,
and after electing a president from its own mem-

bers, select from the State at largea secretary an au executive or health officer, the latter to be  physician. The board is given ample power t protect the State by means of quarantines o otherwise as it sees fit. The full text is not a hand, but from what we see in the dispatches w think the act is carefully worded and yet libera enough to give the board ample breadth of action It was proposed for a time to emasculate th whole action by exempting Pensacola from th jurisdiction of the board, and granting to tha town special health privileges. Fortunately thi was defeated. A board to be efficient must be su-
preme, and not only supreme, but soldi/ and (dim responsible. There must be no bickerings or con-
flict of authority. There is no objection to count or municipal boards of health for the care of loca hygiene and health matters, but it would be fata to the successful work of the State Hoard if thes local boards could in any way supersede or ham-
per the State organization The last epidemic has discovered many fine me in Florida, and we rather imagine that the Gov-
ernor's trouble will be not in finding suitable men,
but in chosing from the large number so wel fitted for the positions.
"We congratulate Florida that she has a board a last, and we are glad to know that she can onc more move on in her line of development, and ca once more open her doors to visitors without fea or criticism.—Xew Orleans Medical and Surgical
Journal Home Sanitation Not only the skilled sanitarian, health officer,
man of science, or medical man can become  practical sanitarian, but each head of a family an each individual can become a health officer, pro-
viding, in a measure, proper sanitation for his im-
mediate home and surroundings. The physica training and development of physical manhood o the Spartans did not depend more on laws an customs than on home influence and self-educa-
tion. So to-day the healthfulness of the home an the consequent vigor of the family do not depend,
or should not, more on the man of science an technical learning than on the care, education,
habits, and the observance of the plain, simpl rules of health of the individual whose observa-
tions every day cover his abode and realm of ex-
istence. Jfo man is entitled to a home unless h can make that home happy and healthful. He ha no right to be the means of bringing misery t others or to leave to posterity the legacy of ill-
health or constitutional weakness. It is the dut of all to be healthy and so observe the laws o hygiene that be may contribute the full measur of his individual well-being to the public good His indifference or neglect of health laws and th observance of the sanitation of his home is no only a crime against himself but the infliction of  wrong on the public and a burden on posterity In this country, with its plan of society and inter-
course, no family is isolated. Whatever condition may produce disease in one family are often re-
sponsible for sickness in others. Cases are record-
ed where disease has had its origin traced to ver remote causes both as to time and place, and thes causes have been found to be the result of neglec in the proper care of the home. The fact tha such cases are not always found in the homes o the destitute and ignorant is evidence that in fam-
ilies of the well-to-do and cultured there is a wan of the observance of the simplest sanitary precau-
tions, which, we are constrained to believe, result more from neglect and indifference than from igno-
rance of the means to be employed,
A mistaken idea prevails that an epidemic mus prevail before there is need for any sanitary pre-
cautions, when the truth is. such epidemics ar always evidence that these precautious have bee fataliy neglected. Moreover, the greatest mortal-
ity does not result, from epidemics, but from death constantly occurring in the course of such disease as are admitted to be wholly preventable, and re-
suit most frequently from the unsanitary condi-
tions of neglected homes, and, in the absence o inspection and preventive means, extend through-
out communities. Such diseases as diphtheria,
scarlet fever, typhoid, and others of this class, ar constantly carrying off their victims, and, in th aggregate, far surpass the deaths in epidemics These diseases, if they do not result directly fro ill-kept homes, find a lodgment, and their viru-
lence and extent is increased. To such a degre has sanitary knowledge been disseminated, an the facilities for gaining such knowledge are s ample, that it is not a Utopian dream to suppos every individual a sanitarian and every home  sanitarium It is not so much the ignorance of health law as it is the ueglect of their observance that is re-
sponsible for the greater portions of ills that afflic humanity. The lesson to be taught is the prope use of the knowledge imparted. The State board of health within the past few years have mad great and rapid advances. Some of the State are so thoroughly organized that on the first ap-
pearance of infectious diseases notification i given, and means for the prevention of their con-
tagion are instantly employed.—Sanitary Sews Registration of Vital Statistics Advan-
tages of.
1. It forms the basis of all sanitary work. In
England their improved system of registration o births, marriages and deaths was begun in 1837,
and since then it has served as a guide to indicat the places where there has been the greatest nee of taking measures to improve the public health If, in a given town it is found that the death rat from typhoid fever, consumption, diarrhceal dis-
eases of children, or other diseases is higher tha it ought to be. the Lo;al Government Board insti-
tutes an inquiry into the causes of the prevailin high rate of mortality. As the result of these in-
quiries local boards have been led in many of th towns to take measures which have reduced th death rate in a marked degree. Massachusett has had its system of registration of vital statistic for many years and finds its records of the greates value in determining general and local rates o mortality, or whether a given disease is less o more prevalent than formerly.
2. To prevent the concealment of crime. Th indispensable provision of modem registration law which requires a certificate from friends or the at-
tending physician of the cause q/ death and a

rection.
3. To ensure the means of proof of persona identity and of right to property. One Senator i our Legislature 1887 told the writer that it cos him fifty dollars to look up the proof of the dat of a birth. The applicants for pensions in Massa-

5. To assist the State in arriving at correct con-

Dr. A G. Toung, Augusta, Maine Decatur Burning Everything That Cam in Contact With Yellow Fever Decatur, Ala., April 1.—The citizens of De-
catur, having totally failed in their efforts to se-
cure any aid from our State Health Officer, Dr Jorotne Cochrane, for the purpose of covering th expense of burning all the infected bedding, etc.,
have pluckily gone to work and taken up a sub-
scription from our own people sufficient to pay fo the whole thing. Every conceivable thing tha could in any way possibly preserve germs durin the winter has been taken to the cemetery an burned. The Simmons Transfer Company wer busily engaged at this all day. The dead house,
situated in the west corner of the cemetery, whic was built for the purpose of taking yellow feve patients immediately after death, was also burned.

The Observer at Parksville notes as follows:
"Our March has been a beautiful month; th last frost was on the 29th; it being dry the frui was not killed; fine prospect for a peach crop The wind has been from the north and west—w have had very little south wind. No big rains o floods during the month The Observer at Nunnelly reports: -'Th thunderstorm of the 16th developed considerabl energy; heavy peals of thunder, with diffuse an zigzag lightning; motion from southwest to north-
east. On the highlands peaches were killed an plums partly killed, and all tender vegetatio more or less affected by the frost on the 29th,
when ice formed nearly one-fourth inch thick Elm and maple budding 10th to 15th. Peaches,
plums and strawberries iu full bloom on the 20th Many species of wild flowers in bloom earlie than usual."
The Observer at Kingston Springs says that the

ing five seconds The Observer at Clarksville reports, on the 15t and 16th, the air very hazy, the sun red, and moo copper colored even on the meridian The observer at Trenton sends the followin notes: Mean temperature for March, 1884-5-6-7-

The observer at Cookeville makes the followin notes regarding the hailstorm of the 18th: “Th clouds began to gather at 3 P. M., and by 4 P. M.
the clouds looked appalling, and we thought w would have a terrible storm. At 4.15 the hail be-
gan to fall; the stones were about the size o partridge eggs. Four miles north of this statio the stones were as large as hens' eggs, and drifte eight feet deep in a valley, and at the presen writing (April 1) is lying four feet deep, and wil remain at least a week longer. A large sack ful of stones was brought to me yesterday. At th same time the severest electrical storm that I hav ever known occurred. The telephone in the Pres office-the central office—was burned out by th lightning; also every wire connected with it.

SUBSCRIPTION, 25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postoflice at Nashville as Second Class Matter Yellow Fever and the United States The outbreak of yellow fever last year in
Florida, which rapidly rose to an event o national note and importance, and th occurrence last month in Sanford, Florida,
of a fatal case, has given this topic re-
newed interest to the American public, an specially to the people of those district which at any time during the past tw decades have been visited by this pesti-
lence. Certain portions of Tennessee wer so severely scourged by yellow fever in
1878 as to give the State a reputation alto-
gether undeserved. The excessive alar manifested by two of the great cities of
Tennessee last year has renewed this fals and malign reputation Tennessee, like New York, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Kentucky, and many other States,
has good reason to be on its guard agains this exotic pest. But while exercising al prudential caution, as does New York espe-
cially, it should like that great State be an feel perfectly impregnable During many years of the past century,
and even as late as 1823, the city of New
York was at intervals visited by epidemic which, looking at the ratio of population,
were quite as terrible as that of New Orlean in 1853, or of Memphis in 1878. To-day
New York is in constant and uninterrupte intercourse with Cuba and other tropica habitats of yellow fever, and no one dream of scare The same statement applies to Philadel-
phia, which in 1798 was the theatre of  terrible epidemic. This commenced August
1st and ended November 1st, with a mor-
tality of 3,500, being 1 in 15.50 of th entire population. Philadelphia does no appear so vigilant as New York city, and a late as 1853 had a spurt, commencing July
10th, ending October; mortality, 128 The curious fact that during the close o the last and the beginning of the presen century yellow fever prevailed in the citie of the northeast, while the cities of th southwest were exempt, and the subsequen change in the record, New York and Phila-
delphia escaping, while New Orleans and
Memphis have been severely scourged, ha much impressed historical and medical in-
vestigators The solution of the enigma is clea enough: Sanitary improvements and pre-
cautions on the one hand and neglect o these on the other. New York and Phila-
delphia have grown from moderate towns to-
take rank with the grandest cities of the

world, and yet are healthier than formerly Our Southern towns and villages have grow into cities, and have too often become pes centres. There is hardly a clean city o village in the South. Personally, we kno not one. Atlanta comes nearest the mar of any lately visited. There is scarcely  hamlet even the soil of which is not satu-
rated by infusion of decomposing huma excreta, or in which the inhabitants do no breathe, during the susceptible hours o sleep, an atmosphere contaminated by ex-
halations from accumulated pits or heaps o decaying foecal matter. When the Anglo-
Saxon first dwelt in said localities, whateve else he suffered from, yellow fever let hi alone. When these localities are restore to pristine purity of soil and air, yello fever will again let him alone. We nee not worry ourselves about the epidemic con-
stitution of the atmosphere, or other occul causes of pestilence, when one so paten and so potent is everlastingly thrust unde our eyes and up our nostrils.
TENNESSEE NOT A YELLOW FEVER STATE New Orleans, during the summer of 1853,
was visited by the most dreadful pestilenc known in its annals. This pestilence als spread far and wide throughout the con-
tiguous and tributary regions. Yet durin that season Memphis was a city of refuge In a very able "Report on the Health and
Mortality of the City of Memphis for the
Year 1853," a large edition of which wa published by the Board of Aldermen, an which was written by Charles T. Quintard,
M. D., then professor in the Memphis
Medical College, occur passages which,
when read by the light of 1867, 1873, 1878
and 1879, are intensely interesting and ful of significant warning to a very large exten of country now reposing in fancied security During that period of desolation and dis-
may in the lower Mississippi country n quarantine regulations were adopted by th municipal authorities, although boats wer landing the sick and dying at the whar nearly every day from New Orleans an other towns below Memphis. Sixty-tw cases were carried from the landing to th hospital, many of, them in a dying condi-
tion. Of these thirty-six proved fatal,
twenty dying within twenty-four hours afte admission. Surely the pest in its mos violent form. No wonder that the goo people of Memphis congratulated them-
selves, and felt that they could safely reiter-
ate the opinion expressed in a report of th previous year, "that yellow fever has neve originated this high up the Mississippi, an that there are no causes in our locality fo originating it."
This statement was true of Memphis, an of all Tennessee in 1853, and it is beyon question true this day yellow fever doe not originate in Tennessee The Report goes on to say: "We believ the principal cause of the great healthful-
ness of our city during the past year is t be found in the salubrity of its location,
and we feel that the corporate authoritie can have no higher duty to perform tha the preservation of this healthfulness. Upo it depends the interest of every departmen of industry."
Here is another noteworthy sentence,
which with the above ought to be clubbe into the head of all municipal authorities in
Tennessee by constant reiteration until sai authorities bestir themselves to action: "I is, then, not a vain boast that Memphis i naturally a place of undoubted healthful-
ness, and all that is required for the main-
tenance of its reputation is that degree o attention to the common sense regulations o sanitary police that have secured to othe cities immunity against diseases that origi-
nated in those causes which it is the ver object of a medical police to remove."
Had the plain axiomatic principles o sanitary science so clearly stated, and s powerfully enforced by the able physician of Memphis in 1853, and later seconde also by her prominent merchants, been

heeded, how very different would have bee the subsequent history of that naturall favored site!
In 1867 came the first epidemic; mor-
tality, 231. Next in 1873 a fearful visita-
tion, commencing September 14th, ending
November 9th; mortality, 2,000. And in
1878 its world-famous plague, 17,600 cases;
deaths, 5,150. This was followed by tha of 1879, commencing July 5th, declared a an end October 25th; cases, 1,595 ; deaths,
497; and gave Memphis a blow perhap more severe than was ever inflicted by  single plague upon any one city. Spreadin through ignorance and carelessness as it di to many towns in West Tennessee, an scourging the mountain-girted city of Chat-
tanooga, it also gave the entire State of
Tennessee a reputation for insalubrity totall undeserved. But for yellow fever Memphi would long ago have reached its five-scor thousand. But for yellow fever the farmin lands of Tennessee would be full ten year ahead of their present slow appreciation But for yellow fever life insurance woul have been within reach of thousands no debarred from its beneficent action. I should be reiterated again and again that
Tennessee is not a yellow fever State a whi more than it is a cholera State. Neithe the plague of Hindoostan nor that of Cub can get within our borders or spread therein
•without gross and inexcusable culpability o the part of the people and their servants,
the constituted public authorities In the last twenty years very grea progress has been made as to how to pre-
vent the introduction and the spread o communicable diseases. The pestilence n longer walketh in darkness. Whatever o mystery may still environ its conception an birth, its beginnings are understood, and it progress may be stayed. We know how i travels. We know how to meet it. Isola-
tion, Disinfection, Sanitation are our watch-
words of defense. Isolation of the indi-
vidual affected, or from the community in-
fected. Disinfection of poisonous deject or contaminated articles. Sanitation o dwellings and surroundings. Twenty year from this time our people will look bac upon the terrors of 1878 and the panics of
1888 with wonderment that so glorious  natural paradise as Tennessee should eve have been the theatre of such tragic scenes,
or such irrational scares.
THE INTERIOR VALLEY NOT SAFE Freedom from panic does not involv fatal carelessness. When yellow fever pre-
vails in any of the Gulf or Atlantic States,
the Appalachian mountain chain, with it high elevations and autumnal midsumme climate, now so easily accessible by numer-
ous railroads, should furnish places of refug for those who desire to leave an infecte neighborhood. The large lowns and citie on the Ohio and the Mississippi, or thei tributaries, should be avoided. The expe-
rience of 1878 fortifies this position Louisville, Kentucky, furnished a mos interesting lesson. Eminent medical pro-
fessors in August maintained the absolut immunity of that populous city from yello fever. Her gates and doors were throw wide open to those fleeing from the dreadfu plague. Her Board of Health declared
"That any attempt at quarantine would no only be galling and detrimental to socia and commercial interests, but would also b inhuman in the extreme." The daily pres all along maintained the immunity of Louis-
ville, and refused to believe its existence i their city. When the storm was over th true state of the case came out from the
"Report of Dr. E. O. Brown," the abl physician of the yellow fever hospital, whos calm heroism and scientific skill met wit high commendations from his fellow-citizens He states that several indigenous cases wer admitted and treated from the infected dis-
tricts of the city, four of whom died.
'' These cases were among the most malig-
nant and fatal cases of yellow fever treate in the hospital, as shown by the tests known

before and after death. In all these fou cases we found in the blood and breat large numbers of active vibras or livin germs. I can safely say that if these wer not cases of yellow fever, we admitted non to our hospital from the South. ... I this connection I will here say that ther were fifty or more cases of yellow feve originated in what is called the infected dis-
trict, of which twenty-eight died. . .  Opposite the northwest corner of Elevent and Maple streets the baggage-room of the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad is sit-
uated, where a large amount of baggage,
movables, bedding, etc., were stored, som of which remained there for a number o days. Many of those that contracted th disease were employed in some capacit about the depot. After a careful survey o the locality and its surroundings, and  close study of the cause, I am forced to th conclusion that the disease was transmitte to the inhabitants of this district by infec-
tion, and that the disease is infectious an portable I am thoroughly convinced, no only from what transpired in this particula locality, but from a careful study of th case of the steamer Porter and her barges."
It is evident that in 1878 Louisville nar-
rowly missed the experience of Chatta-
nooga. It is also evident that under  favorable concatenation of circumstance that beautiful city may witness such scene as in the past have given certain years sa memorability in New York, Philadelphia,
New Orleans and Memphis Dr. T. C. Minor, formerly Health Office of Cincinnati, in a vaiuable "Report on
Yellow Fever in Ohio," mentions severa indigenous cases as occurring in Cincinnati Perhaps many others would have followe but for the timely precautions used. At
Gallipolis, Ohio, the disease became epi-
demic, and very fatal. Hence, Dr. Minor,
though in 1877 taking the ground that yel-
low fever had never appeared in Ohio, an holding the almost unanimous opinion of th medical profession, that Cincinnati woul never be subjected to an epidemic of yello fever, for the reason that its altitude an. climate were such as to prevent the devel-
opment of indigenous cases, states (1889)
that his views have been materially modi-
fied within the short space of one year Some little personal experience with th disease during the summer just past (1878)
has caused this radical change of opinion The results at Bowling Green in 1878 ar also most instructive. This at that tim small but most beautifully situated city i the junction of the Memphis branch of the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad with th main stem. Relying upon its great salu-
brity and the lofty hills in and around it limits, refugees from West Tennessee wer freely admitted, with clothing, baggage, etc Car-loads of these were in or around th station at intervals and for varying period of time. Result, such a spat of the diseas as renders the people of Bowling Gree very keenly alive to the dangers of yello fever Chattanooga, then as now the gateway o the South, with proverbial indifference t the warnings of its able physicians, was i a very unsanitary condition. Nevertheless,
relying also upon altitude and climate, i invited the frightened fugitives to halt an enjoy her hospitality. Dearly was thi ignorance and thoughtlessness punished b a fearful pestilence, which, commencing
September 1, 1878, scattered her people t the four winds until autumnal frosts mad it safe to return Nashville, between Bowling Green and
Chattanooga, ventured upon an experimen which gave her no small fame and man plaudits at the time. There was absolut freedom of traffic and travel. Chattanooga,
Bowling Green and all West Tennessee sen their refugees by scores, who were all heart-
ily welcomed. On the other hand, the cit and outlying suburbs were put in perfec sanitary condition by the expenditure of

over seven thousand dollars. An infirmary,
with skilled nurses and physicians was pro-
vided. During the season twenty-four case occurred among the refugees and thirtee deaths. A number of the deaths were i private houses and in widely separated por-
tions of the city. In each case thoroug disinfection by fire and otherwise was prac-
ticed. No well authenticated instance of a indigenous case occurred. Yet those con-
ducting this experiment, who also receive unanimous and warm thanks from the peopl of Nashville for their brilliant success, i their "Report," published 1879, take occa-
sion to say: "If next summer, or in an subsequent summer, Memphis and othe towns in West Tennessee or elsewhere ar in danger from the yellow fever poison, le the people scatter, and that speedily. Le them also avoid cities, more especially ver large cities, in an uncleanly state, or situate in very low bottoms, for without very grea care in those localities the poison carried b them may spread. Again, it is natural tha the inhabitants of cities like St. Louis, Cin-
cinnati and Chicago, do not desire to b visited by crowds of refugees from a yello fever region, for should this fearful pesti-
lence once break out in these densely packe and imperfectly hygienized cities, the dam-
age done to life, and property would be in-
calculable. Even such cities as Nashville,
Clarksville, Murfreesboro, Columbia and
Knoxville should not be overcrowded wit such refugees. Certainly not without th utmost care . gainst infected articles, an the most complete exercise of sanitar purity American Resorts, with Notes Upon Their
Climate By Bushrod W. James, A. M., M. D. Philadel-
phia and London, 1889 This is the title of an octavo volume of
300 pages, intended for invalids and thos who desire to preserve good health in  suitable climate. Its author has given muc attention to sanitary topics, and has com-
piled this book for the general public, a well as the medical profession. It is an in-
teresting summary of a very wide field. Th principal mountain and seaside resorts an mineral springs pass in rapid review. Sum-
mer and winter resorts receive attention Full stress is laid upon the connection o climate with disease and cure. Mexico and
South America, as well as the High North,
are included in this treatise equally with the
United States. Tennessee makes a ver modest appearance. No pains having bee taken by our own people to give her the re-
pute she should enjoy as a sanitarium, w have only ourselves to blame. Only tw places are specially mentioned—Cloudlan among the mountain resorts, and Montval among the mineral springs Criminal Neglect. ,
No man is entitled to a home unless he ca make that home happy and healthful. He has n right to bo the means of bringing misery to other or leave posterity the legacy of ill-health or con-
stitutional weakness. It is the duty of all to b healthy, and so observe the laws of hygiene tha they may contribute the full measure of their in-
dividual well being to the public good. His indif-
ference or neglect of health laws and the observ-
ance of the sanitation of his home is not only  crime against himself, but the infliction of a wron on the public and a burden on posterity In this country, with its plan of society and in-
tercourse, no family is isolated. Whatever condi-
tions may produce disease in one family are ofte responsible for sickness in others. Cases are re-
corded where disease has had its origin traced t very remote causes, both as to time and place,
and these causes have been found to be the resul of neglect in the proper care of the home. Th fact that such cases are not always found in th homes of the destitute and ignorant is evidenc that in families of the well-to-do and culture there is a want of the observance of the simples sanitary precautions, which, we are constrained t believe', results more from neglect and indifferenc than from ignorance of the means to he employed Fourth Annual Report of the Kansas State Boar of Health, page 8 Havana and Filth The city of Havana has a population estimate at two hundred and four thousand. It is bu partly drained. Old-time privies and cesspool poison the air and soak the earth with tceca poisons Its whole sub-soil is contaminated. When in
Havana in November of the year previous, I pur-
posely visited the docks near La Machina, in th vicinity of the custom house, where the entranc to the harbor is narrow, and where the vesselB fo want of space lie side by side.

months. We owe much to commerce and rapi transit. We are also indebted to it for epidemic of yellow fever. With proper sanitary precaution the southern United States would be free from al future epidemics of yellow jack. But will the bef I doubt it. Why f Because "corporation have no souls to damn and no backs to kick," an because mankind is selfish and grasping in th search for riches The entrance to the harbor of Havana require special mention. To place this word sketch be-
fore you clearly, let me give full details. Th entrance to the harbor may be six hundred fee across. The harbor may be described as a smal salt lake, perhaps a mile and a half or two mile long, by three-fourths of a mile across its broades part. The entrance to the harbor is guarded b the old - time historic fortifications, called El
Morro. Just opposite, or across the entrauce, ar other fortifications, covered with hugh siege guns,
on the city side. Remember, the narrow, gate-
like entrance, a mere water lane, and beyond th harbor, receiving all the filth and sewage men-
tioned. As oue would expect who has travele in the West Indies, Mexico, Central and South
America, Havana, owing to the old-time closets,
want of drainage, sub-soil contamination, etc., i a disease-producing and distributing center. Th air in certain sections recks with the vile faeca odor so familiar to all travelers in Spanish-Ameri-
can cities within the tropics. Huge street grating ventilate the few drains, and the reeking odor almost stifle one in the crowded centers. Thes drains are never flushed, except by the heav rains, and if flushed would only empty their fer-
menting contents into the bay below.
A mere reference to fn'cal fermentation withi the tropics to all students of disease is ample,
without entering into specific details. I may ad inter alia that there are some students of yello fever who believe—and undoubtedly their belief i a just one—that the focal matter from yellow feve patients is as essentially dangerous as are th stools from typhoid fever patients. The point I
wish to make, and impress upon my readers, i this: That the poison of yellow fever is just a much a part and parcel of the city of Havana a the houses and churches of New York are a par of that noble city. I make bold to state that th yellow fever poison is as much an article of expor from that island as are its famous cigars. Whil tho harbor is foul and dangerous, the city is th habitat of vellow jack.—Dr. Wolfrcd Nelson, Feb-
ruary 22, 1889 Cleanliness and Quarantine Proposition—In a warm climate continued clean-
liness is the best safeguard against yellow fever Question First—Granted an unsanitary condi-
tion of a town, as Macclenny or Jacksonville, ma yellow lever originate spontaneously?
Answer—No! The advanced doctrine is, "N germ, no yellow fever;" but, inasmuch as th germ has not been found, let the chance b divided Question Second—Granted an unsanitary condi-
tion of a town, city or residence, and the importa-
tion of yellow fever germ, what will be th result?
Answer—The result will be yellow fever Question Third—Granted a city, town or localit kept continuously clean, free from all "foci," wil yellow fever become epidemic, importation or no-
importation of germ?
Answer—No! A place may be kept yello fever proof Corollary — An unsanitary condition gives  chance and a half for yellow fever. A sanitar condition gives none.
I know it is held by many physicians that  rigid quarantine is the best preventive against yel-
low fever. That the disease is spread by germs i true; but that it is impossible to prevent the in-
troduction of germs from abroad by the presen modes of quarantine is fully proved by the past Iu the first place, it is necessary to know wha places are to be quarantined against. But th germs may be brought from a place where th yellow fever is not known to exist To prevent panic and the loss of trade the firs appearance of the disease is invariably kept secret,
in the hope that it may be stamped out before i becomes epidemic, and thus the germs may b scattered far and wide before any warning is given Then the system of quarantine now in use is s onerous that all means are tried to evade it; an if but one person passes having the germs of dis-
ease, all the labor and annovauce has been iu vain Not that quarantine should be abandoned; kee out the germs as far as possible, but provide tha if, despite all precautions, they are iutroduced,
they will fall upon clean places, where they can-
not propagate. Treasure quarantine, but make i pleasant and not hateful.—Dr. IV. C. VauBibber Prevention of Yellow Fever Unclean Villages.
I am personally quite familiar with this subjec from actual observation in many of the cities an towns in the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, New York, the Dominion of Canada,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and 1 may add Florida also.
I know that the yards uttached to houses are,
for the most part, from one hundred to one hun-
dred and fifty feet deep, more or less, and are gen-
erally surrounded with decaying board fence eight feet high and these enclosed yards bnv been, as a rule, the receptacles for all" the refus matters of families for a long time. Thus it wil readily be seen that they affect the air of thos dwellings which are near to them, as well as thos to which they are attached From an eminence in the State of Mississippi I
once beheld a beautiful village, which, when see in the early morning, with cluster roses and creep-
ers covering the roofs of its houses, looked like  fairy city of enchantment. Who would have sup-
posed, from the distance at which I stood, that i was then the abode of a deadly yellow fever pesti-
lence? Its board-screened yards, undrained, leve and water-soaked, were filled with things offensiv and useless, which sheer carelessness had allowe to accumulate Its cemetery was daily being filled from no othe cause than the neglect of its inhabitants. It ma be answered therefore that cities and towns, espe-
cially in a warm climate, which are built and kep in a manner similar to what has been described,
cannot be said to have come up to the standard o continued cleanliness.—Dr. W. C. Van Bibber, Pre-
vention of Yellow Fever.

Filth Think of the numerous towns and cities in ou own State (Kansas), where people have herde together for a decade or more, without one single
"cleaning-up time"; think of the stench con-
stantly arising during our long warm season,
tainting the air, wells poisoned by undergroun drainage from cesspools, or the inadequately fil-
tered water of the larger cities, murdering by de-
grees every one within the town; think further o the lameutable ignorance concerning the conse-
quences of these things among the many in tow and country; and then I will ask, is it not mee and right and the bounden duty of every govern-
ment to interfere in these matters 1 Is it not im-
perative that each State shall enact and enforce,
rigidly, laws that shall rid the land of its contam-
inating filth?
Scattered among the masses are many who d know, and fully realize, the terrible consequence of this criminal neglect, who try with all thei power to keep things about them sweet and clean,
and who yet are compelled to breathe the sur-
rounding atmosphere, filled with its poison, unles they cease forever to breathe, as very many do;
many who, perchance, have to watch by th death-bed of a loved one, dying of some filth dis-
ease, such as typhoid fever, diphtheria, etc.,
caused by neighbors' filth—murdered, just as muc as if these criminally-negligent neighbors had will-
fully killed the poor sufferer, and yet who mus quietly submit, and listen to a Iouk rigmarole o the dispensations of Providence, as they consig the precious forms of the dear ones to the cold,
cold grave. Providence, indeed! Filth, my kin hearers; nothing but tilth. I have no patienc with this " Hand of Providence" preaching in th affairs of men, when nine times out of ten man' troubles come through his own or somebody' thoughtlessness Haviug lived in one of these new Western towns
(not that towns in other localities are any better),
where there has never been any serious attemp at sanitary measures, and by force of circum-
stances obliged to live in the thickest settled por-
tion of the city, and where, during the heate term, life at times has seemed anything but desir-
able, I know whereof I write. I have talked an talked, and even begged through the columns o the weekly newspapers, that something might b done; have publicly told those in authority whe some dread scourge was doing its worst that i was caused by criminal neglect, yet never a re-
sponse worthy the name; perhaps one or two reek-
ing vaults in my immediate vicinity have bee covered up, an obnoxious pig-pen removed, is all
I have accomplished ; and in my extremity I hav longed for higher power to appeal to. And ye how soon a ibree of men with an orderly, clea housewife as overseer, could cleanse and renovat any small town, if every, mau could but see th necessity or be made to see it.—Mrs. J. M. Pat-
ten, in Fourth Annual Report of the Kansas State

"For a period of nearly twenty years, durin which I have been employed in a very large field,
I have never known scarlet fevor to spread in  single instance beyond the sick-room, and in  very few iustances within it." The rules which h laid down to accomplish so favorable a result wit a disease so infoctious were few and simple, bu imperative. They were essentially the same a those which are now generally employed by loca authorities in all parts of the world, and by mean of which they meet with an amount of succes commensurate with the wisdom of the laws, th efficiency of the local officers, and the intelligen co-operation of the people at large. What is sai of scarlet fever is equally true of diphtheria,
typhoid fever and measles.—Fourth Annual Repor of Kansas State Board of Health,

A dark house is almost always unhealthy; al-
ways an ill-aired house. Want of light stop growth, and promotes scrofula, rickets, consump-
tion, etc., especially among children. Peopl lose their health in a dark house, and if they go ill they cannot get well again in it.—Florence

9th, and the catbird on the 13th Fireflies appeared at Riddleton and Nunnelly o the 9th The observer at Greeneville reports that sno fell on the TJnaka Mountains on the 28th, an could be seen until noon on the 29th. Snow wa also reported on the same mountains, forty mile south of Knoxville, on the 28th and 29th The observer at RogerBville reports that fores fires prevailed from the 6th to the llth, and ex-
tended over a large territory along the Clinch
Mountains, doing but little damage, except t timber The observer at Nunnelly reports that fores fires prevailed in the vicinity of that station fro the 3d to the 6th The rainfall at Knoxville was the least recorde for April during the eighteen years beginning with
1871, the next being 1.93 inch, in 1885. Th greatest April rainfall during that period was in
1874, when the unprecedented fall of 17.32 inche was recorded The deficiency in rainfall for the four months,
from January 1st, at the U. S. Signal Stations, a shown by the table elsewhere, is as follows:
Knoxville, 8.71 inches; Chattanooga, 7.85 inches;
Nashville, 10.01 inches; Memphis, 7.41 inches Sergt. L. M. Pindell, TJ. S. Observer at Chatta-
nooga, furnishes the following data of rainfall fo the month at stations outside the State: Murphy,
N. C, 2.33 inches; Asheville, N. C, 1.15 inch;
Charleston, N. C, 1.74 inch Sergt. J. B. Marbury, TJ. S. Observer at Nash-
ville, kindly furnishes the following notes con-
cerning a remarkable meteor observed by him:
"At 11.15 p. m., on the 22d, a most brillian meteor was observed passing from the northeas quadrant of the heavens. It apparently starte at an altitude of 20°, and passed rapidly up to th zenith, where it seemed to hesitate for a second,
and suddenly shoot off across the sky in a south-
east direction, forming an angle of about 80° The track was marked by a stream of silver light of dazzling brilliancy. Prom the northeas side of this track sparks of light were thrown oi at intervals, indicating that the motion of th meteor was circular, as well as forward, th sparks being thrown from the body by centrifuga force. During the time it remained in the zenit a very distinct corona, about 8° in diameter, wa noticed. Prom this it would seem that the change,
of course, was due to an increased gyratory mo-
tion, caused by sudden contact with some dens and impenetrable substance, which finally force it off to the east-southeast, where less resistanc was found. The meteor disappeared at 11.16
p. m."
The Sergeant also makes the following summar for the month at his station:
■'The average atmospheric pressure was some-
what lower than the normal for the past sixteen-
years. The highest barometer, 30.46, occurre on the 7th, accompanied by a slight cold wave,
which reduced the temperature to 33°, the min-
imum for the month. The temperature was-
slightly in excess of the normal—maximum tem-
perature, 85° on the llth. On the 12th Nashville-
was in the southeast quadrant of a low barometri area, which caused the severe hail storm and heav rain accompanied by a thunder storm. A col wave signal was ordered np on the 3d, the only-
one during the month. A second (distant) thunde storm occurred on the 24th. The total rainfall fo the month, 2.83 inches, is, with the exception of
1886, the smallest amount recorded for April dur-
ing the past eighteen years. So far this has bee an exceptionally dry season, there being a defi-
ciency of over ten inches since January 1 The observer at Riddleton makes the followin notes: "One of the most remarkable thunder an rain storms at this station for several years was.
that of the 12th, in which 2.01 inches of rain an hail fell in the space of throe hours—the greate portion in one hour, and over 1.50 inches fell be-
tween 3.50 and 4.30 p. m., as recorded by the self-
registering-rain gauge at this station. The barom-
eter and thermometer both fell very fast durin the storm—the thermometer fell from 80° to 62°
in thirty minutes. The storm was accompanie with heavy gusts of wind from west southwest,
blowing at the rate of 35 to 40 miles per hour for  few minutes, although tho highest hourly velocit was 19 miles. The heavy fall of rain did a grea deal of damage, washing hill-side lands badly an flooding bottom lands. The hail storm accom-
panying the rain lasted from 3.50 to 5 p. m.—th stones were as large as marbles. (What sized mar-
bles, Prank?—Ed.) In drift places bushels o stones could have been gathered up. Hail also fel on the 24th from 11.50 p. m. to 12.10 a. m. on the
25th, the stones were small but fell very fast. Th month has been, altogether, very favorable for th seeding and growing of crops, the temperatur being very near the normal for the past six years,
while the rainfall was considerably in excess—0.98
inch. The wind movement was slightly above th normal, although there were no severe velocitie recorded."
The observer at Springdale makes the followin notes: "Corn is coming up badly; a large pe cent of young clover has died; oats, clover an meadows look badly; wheat has also been hurt t some extent by the dry weather. Peaches hav fallen off until there seems to be not more tha half a crop on the trees; cherries also have falle some; apples in abundance—the crop is the larges ever known in this county—almost every goo farmer has a young orchard of standard trees tha come into bearing this year for the first timo.''
The observer at Nunnelly makes the followin notes: "April has been variable—high winds pre-
vailing throughout the month—light rains fallin about the middle of the month, the first and latte parts dry, the latter very dry with cool nights,
which checked the growth of crops. Cut worm*
doing considerable damage to corn, Colorad beetles doing some damage to potatoes, caterpillar*
denuding the wild cherry trees of leaves and doing-
some damage also to peach and apple trees."
The observer at Parksville notes as follows:
"This has been a very dry month, and clover an oats have suffered, but a good stand of com has

The observer at Watkins notes as follows:
“Some fruit has been killed that was thought safe,
especially apples. Plenty of peaches yet, but I
have not seen a single one that has not been stun by the curculio. All crops looking fine, but mor rain needed."
The observer at Clarksville reports that on the
12th a high wind prevailed-hail reported in som parts of the county, and a very heavy hail stor in the adjacent parts of Kentucky The observer at Austin reports on the 24th heav hail three to four miles north of station, accom-
panied by heavy rain, thunder and diffuse lightning The observer at Woodstock reports the hailstor of the 12th quite severe in other sections of Shelb county, north and east The observer on Lookout Mountain says that o the 4th at 2 p. m. the only north wind during th month was noted, and the only northwest wind o the 25th at 9 p. m As will be seen by the tabulated reports, thre new stations have been added to the list, viz. :
Dunlap, Sequachee county, in charge of Mr. Lewis
Boynton, our former faithful and efficient observe at Farmingdale; McMinnville, Warren county, i charge of Prof. E. W. Doran, State Entomologist,
and Tullahoma, Coffee county, in charge of Mr Ed. S. Jones, editor of The Progressive Age. Al these give promise of much good to the service, a they are in the hands of competent men It is the painful duty of the Assistant Directo to announce the death of Mr. Charles Foster, of

SUBSCRIPTION, - 25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postoffice at Nashville as Second Class Matter On the Appalachian Health Resorts of
Tennessee Time out of mind mineral waters hav enjoyed great repute with the people, be-
cause of real or reputed efficacy as thera-
peutic agents. Waters and baths in th luxurious period of the Roman emperors,  period of profligacy and decline, were i constant use by the wealthy of that time Names of favorite resorts in Europe at thi day are memorials of that time, as we hav more than one Aix In our day, salt water and sea-shore ai have caused the opening of a vast numbe of health resorts on both continents High mountains, because of scenery an climate, now divide the public patronag with mineral springs and sea bathing. O late years, mountains have grown so rapidl in favor with invalids as well as with stou tourists, as to justify the appellation of in-
dustrial resources to the atmosphere sur-
11.
rounding these ordinarily sterile height no less than to the rich metallic ores con-
cealed within their depths In 1848 we saw the White Mountains of
New Hampshire visited by hundreds and!
bringing rich revenues to the few hostelries-
and scattered farms of the narrow valleys in*
that region. In i860 we saw thousands-
there, filling to overflowing many larg hotels, and scattering gold far and wide Now, hundreds of thousands annually visi these bleak hills, crowd immense palatia hotels, and distribute money by the million In Switzerland, between the period of ap-
proach by horse power some years since,
and by s'eam power more recently, we hav seen a like wonderful change. All Europ pays tribute to that mountain land, to whic also America sends a large tribute East of the Rocky Mountains no State i so favored with sites for mountain healt resorts of every variety and purpose as is ou own ribbon-shaped Tennessee, by reason o the Appalachian chain which falls withi her limits. Hitherto, inaccessibility ha caused this magnificent region to be over-
looked. The great lines of railway now i process of construction will, at an early day,
penetrate this huge mass of mountains wit eight or ten thoroughfares, bringing it withi a few hours reach of nearly all the grea cities of the interior valley, gulf, and south
Atlantic coasts. To the cities of Tennesse and circumjacent States these Appalachian will furnish the nearest and cheapest healt resorts. It is time that the medical an general public of Tennessee should becom buSItin.

STATE BO ABB OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
acquainted with the beauty and value of thi hitherto slighted region Dr. Gerard Troost, the eminent pionee geologist of Tennessee, in his reports upon
Sevier and Cocke Counties, as far back as
1837, dwelt upon the great future of East
Tennessee, and followed up the topic i subsequent papers printed in American and
European scientific periodicals. He alway maintained that the East was the wealthies and leading division of the State, and tim is rapidly demonstrating his thesis.
GENERAL FEATURES As far back as 1819, Mr. John H. Kain,
of Tennessee, in a contribution to Silli-
man's Journal, vol. 1, p. 60, gives an out-
line of this region, the accuracy of which i readily verified by the most casual ob-
server:
"The most prominent as well as the mos beautiful features of this country, is tha succession of mountain and valley, ridg and vale, which we meet with in traversin its surface.
"The grand range of Alleghany Moun-
tains enters Virginia about the 39th degre of north latitude, and, pursuing a south-
western course, spreads out upon the eas end of Tennessee and terminates near th southern boundary line of that State, in the
Alabama territory, and about the 34th par-
allel of north latitude. In this view ar included the Blue Mountains, the North
Mountains, the Alleghany (properly s called), the Cumberland, Clinch, Iron, and
Smoky Mountains, together with a variet of smaller mountains, spurs and ridges, al running parallel to each other, from th northeast to the southwest, and all, I be-
lieve I may say, covered with forests, an presenting to the eye of the naturalist  most interesting field for speculation an improvement.
"With a few exceptions, the geologis meets with none of those remarkable ap-
pearances which indicate the changes an convulsions which have been wrought b time, the great enemy of nature. Occa-
sionally we are presented with a view of  sublime precipice, formed by sections whic a river appears to have made for itsel through an opposing mountain; and th large masses of ruins which he scattere around such a place, seem, to the imagina-
tion of the solitary traveler, the historica records of commotions, awful even in retro-
spect. Most commonly, however, the moun-
tains seem to have lain for ages in undis-
turbed repose, and the streams of water,
when they have crossed them, have sough an easy passage through the ravines, whic do not so often divide a mountain, or ridge,
at right angles, as wind between the ends o two opposing spurs which pass each other,
gradually declining into the champaign coun-
try at their mutual base. Through thi whole extent of country we rarely meet wit any remarkable falls of water; the obviou reason of which is, that the rocks are s soft they are easily worn down to the leve of the beds of rivers. But shoals, or shal-
lows, are frequent, and are formed by bed of rounded sandstone, spread out into  broad base, over which the water ofte rushes with no small violence and noise.
"The mountains are generally, thoug not always, sterile, and produce nothing bu forest trees; but the valleys are, with hardl an exception, rich, and productive of ever variety of 'grass and herb-yielding seed,
and fruit-tree yielding fruit.' Nor are the less favored in the mineral kingdom; pos-
sessing the greatest abundance of all th most useful and necessary minerals."
In Killebrew's Resources of Tennessee,
we find a description of this region also quit to our purpose:
"The eastern system of the mountains of
North America is known as the Appalachian
. system. It begins in a broad, low hill, nea the mouth of the St. Lawrence, in Canada,
and keeping approximately parallel to the
Atlantic coast, extends through Vermont,
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, North Carolina and Tennessee, an loses itself in broad, low hills in the norther parts of Georgia and Alabama. The charac-
teristic feature of the whole system is, tha it is made up of parallel ranges, separate by valleys of remarkably uniform width These ranges are not continuous, but ar broken up into stretches of various lengths The outer ranges sink down into low, broa ridges, but maintain, almost without excep-
tion, the general parallelism of the large central ranges. The extreme length of the
Appalachians is about thirteen hundred
(1,300) miles, and the greatest width fro east to west, about one hundred (100)

193
miles. This is about midway the length of
Pennsylvania and Maryland.
"Without the towering height of the Alp or the massive grandeur of the Rocky Moun-
tains, there is still much of interest attachin to the Appalachians to excite the study o men of science. Accordingly, many dis-
tinguished geologists of America and Europ have made a study of different sections o these mountains and have felt well paid fo their labors. But the results of their vari-
ous labors are only to be found in separat reports and society papers, and a full an satisfactory account of the entire system re-
mains yet to be written.
"In each State, local names are given t the various ranges which make up the sys-
tem, and most of the school geographie have created confusion by failing to recog-
nize the fact that these local ranges are bu parts of one grand system. That part o the system which passes through Tennessee,
has been appropriately named the Unaka
Range and the Cumberland Table Land These ranges are in turn composed of vari-
ous subordinate mountains and ridges hav-
ing local names and special features to dis-
tinguish them. The Unaka and the Cum-
berland ranges are moreover separated b the Valley of the Tennessee.
"The Unaka Range lies between the
States of Tennessee and North Carolina, it central crest forming, for the most part, th dividing line between the two States.
"The Valley of East Tennessee is in tur made up of numerous subordinate valleys,
lying almost parallel. So that an orographi view would present the appearance of a grea valley with a floor fluted by low ranges o mountains, running almost parallel with th two great ranges that form the sides.
"The general trend of lhese aanges i from northeast to southwest. At irregula intervals the valley is partially intersected b short ridges or spurs, breaking off from an lying at nearly right angles to them. Thes parallel ranges and transverse ridges exer-
cise a very powerful influence on the climat of East Tennessee. The trend of all th parallel ranges is northeast and southwest,
-while the dip of the floor of the valley i almost uniformly to the southwest. Nea the Virginia line, the elevation of the valle floor is between 1,300 and 1,400 feet, whil near the Georgia line it falls to about 800,
the direct distance being 175 miles. In ad-
dition to this southwesterly dip, the entir plane of the valley has a northwesterly in-
clination, in keeping with the general incli-
nation of the plane of the State.
"On the east, the mountain range which
Prof. Safford has named the Unaka, is by-
far the grandest and most massive chain o mountains east of the Mississippi, and pre-
sents many peculiar and interesting feature but little known. The elevations along the
State line vary from about 6.500 to about
3,000 feet. The Cumberland Mountains or
'Table Land,'lying west of the valley, i much lower and possesses bi't few of thos wild and massive features which characteriz the Unakas. It varies in elevation, alon its easterm rim, from 2,000 to 3,000 feet."
In 1818, the Rev. Elias Cornelius, of New
York, made an extensive geological tou through Virginia, Tennessee, and the Ala-
bama and Mississippi territories, and dwell with the enthusi.ism of a genuine lover o nature upon the beauty of the countr through which he passed, and of its bound-
less future promise. He tersely sums u one of the most remarkable features of Ten-
nessee, in Sillima-n's Journal, vol. 1, p. 221:
"The Cumberland Mountain is a singula formation. It belongs to the class called
'Table Mountains.' Its width varies fro a few miles to more than fifty, its height i not perceptibly different from that of the
Blue Ridge. It forms a circuit, in a shap somewhat resembling a half moon. Wind-
ing to the southwest, it keeps a course nort of the Tennessee River, in some place nearly parallel with it; passes a few miles t the southeast in the Alabama territory, an not long after terminates. At one part,
over which I crossed, the mountain i eighteen miles wide. This is about 150
miles southwest of Knoxville, a little nort of the 35th degree of north latitude."
Dr. Henry O. Marcy, of Boston, on Oct.
29, 1885, read before the American Aoud-
emy of Medicine, New York, an elaborat paper on "The Climatic Treatment of Dis-
ease: Western North Carolina as a Health
Resort." Dr. Marcy is so well known t the medical profession of America as one o its most eminent practitioners, that we shal freely use his work with the hope of awak-
ening at least some of our own busy brethren

to the study of climatology and mountai climbing here at home or next door. Wha he says of this region at large is even mor true of Tennessee than of the Mother State His general summary is excellent:
"The mountains of the Alleghany rang have been known to some extent as afford-
ing interesting and health-giving resorts fo summer recreation, and in the souther ranges furnishing summer homes for the res-
idents of Southern States. The entire rang is free from malaria, and Asheville, in west-
ern North Carolina, has grown to a villag of about 5,000 inhabitants, chiefly as a sum-
mer resort. The Alleghanies divide, in th northern part of North Carolina, into the
Blue Ridge and the Smokies, the latter th boundary line between that State and Ten-
nessee. The triangle thus formed, with
South Carolina and Georgia on the south,
is filled with cross ranges of mountains, an comprises a territory of about 50,000 squar miles. The entire section is elevated in th bed of the streams, or valleys, to about
2,000 feet above the sea, and presents  most irregular surface; a sea of mountai peaks, ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 feet i height. Within an area of fifty miles ther are twenty peaks over 6,000 feet high; nine-
tenths of the entire district is an unbroke primeval forest of the largest growth,chiefl of deciduous trees. It is the oldest geologi-
cal formation on the continent, of graniti character, and gives the most unmistakabl evidence of the corroding tooth of time Not a lake or a swamp is to be found in th entire region, a fact perhaps without a par-
allel for an area of equal extent in th world. Feldspar is the predominating facto in the granite, and owing to its easy decom-
position, the rocks have worn more rapidly,
giving an excellent soil for tree-growth an the purest water, as seen in an endless serie of pearly, musical rivulets.
"With a sparse population, such soil an water, there cannot be otherwise than a pur atmosphere. Owing to the difficulties o making railroads in such a mountainou country, until quite recently, the larger por-
tion of this region has been more inaccessi-
ble than Colorado, and no part of the United
States, east of the Mississippi, equally large,
is prob bly to-day so little known or pos-
sessed of equal natural advantages, so en-
tirely undeveloped.
"The absence of mosquitoes, gnats an black flies will speak volumes in favor o these mountain forests to those who hav sought recreation in the wilds of our borde lands in any direction. The lack of civil-
izing comforts is the present drawback, an the invalid who ventures a residence i these remote mountain recesses must pro-
vide for himself nearly everything approach-
ing a luxury. The lover of nature of eithe sex will find plenty to occupy and fill th hours with delightful study. It is, however,
no place for one seriously ill, and the chroni grumbler will never want for occasion t exercise his spleen. The absence of goo roads and bridges make locomotion difficult The saddle offers the best of exercise an the surest means of travel, but the railroad approaching from every direction give prom-
ise of a new era. The mineral wealth, for-
est growth and productive soil are in evi-
dence of the prosperity to come. The pur air, water and climate hold out a hopefu helpfulness to invalids from every land The wise legislator, seeking far-reaching re-
sults, would do well to consider the advisa-
bility of securing, under State control,  large reservation of the higher ranges as  park. Its cost, at present, would be merel nominal. Like the peaks and glaciers of
Switzerland, its indirect returns of monetar gain would be more sure than bonded inter-
est, and its sanitary advantages would be o a value incalculable to millions yet un-
born."
Having thus given a very brief descrip-
tion of the large extent of country embrace under our caption, and which we purpos very much to enlarge in subsequent num-
bers of the Bulletin, attention is called t the bearings of this topic upon the daily-
practice of medicine Here again we use the thoroughly studie language of Dr. Marcy; calling marked at-
tention to the fact that the whole medica world is beginning to realize and act upor the close connection of climatology wit the cause, prevention and cure of disease.
"Based upon the belief that an asepti atmosphere is of the first importance in th selection of a climate for the benefit of suf-
ferers from a certain class of diseases, exam-
inations of the atmosphere have been care-
fully made to demonstrate its purity. Miguel

and Freudenreich found that mycrophyte were rare at 800 metres, and absolutel wanting at 2,000 metres above the sea level For physical reasons, high altitudes hav been believed to be beneficial in earl phthisics, and, influenced by the latter dem-
onstrations of a bacillary cause, this asepti state of the atmosphere is theoretically ac-
cepted as promising good results, and sani-
tary stations for mountain-air treatment o consumptives have been established at sev-
eral selected points in the Alps, where th comforts of home life are furnished to inva-
lids. Of these health resorts, Davos and
St. Moritz are the most popular. St. Morit is 6,000 feet and Davos is over 5,000 fee above the sea level, and the latter has be-
come noted for winter treatment, althoug the average temperature from November to
March is only 230 Fahr. The number o visitors at Davos last winter (1884-85) wa over i,ooo, and careful provision is mad for home comfort. The patients are urged
-to be active out of doors within the limit o fatigue. Each year adds 10 the number o invalids resorting to these mountain sanita-
ria, and the statistics show good results. I should, however, be borne in mind that th cases sent to these resorts are those selecte in the incipient stages of disease, and this i to be taken into the account in the deduc-
tions that the recoveries average one-fourth;
also the time elapsing after the treatmen has been too short to determine with accu-
racy the results. This pertains in criticis to the statistics of other similar localities,
bat it is by no means an easy task to secur satisfactory data, and such a problem ca never be subjected to a mathematical analy-
sis.
"The chemical and mechanical laws o life have, hitherto, almost entirely engage the attention of investigators in the study o the circumfusa of the invalid. For a num-
ber of years committees from the America and British Medical Associations have bee engaged in securing data for the compariso of the invasion of acute diseases with mete-
orological changes. Although these latte are largely*factors in the problem, they hav a much wider significance than usually sup-
posed, since they make possible condition not only devitalizing to the individual bu favoring in many instances the growth an development of infectious germs. The tide and changes of the great atmospheric ocean,
in which we are submerged, are of the ut-
most significance. Its weight as measure by the barometer, indicates the pressur which our bodies sustain. The moisture i suspension not only increases the weight,
but modifies its influence upon the individ-
ual, and this is measured by the hygrometer The changes of atmospheric temperature, a recorded by the thermometer, are of well-
recognized importance.
"The atmosphere also varies in its com-
position, of which, from our present stand-
point of consideration, oxygen and ozon may he accepted as the most significant,
since these agents materially lessen th growth and development of all the mycro-
scopic forms of plant life. From the ob-
servations of a number of our most compe-
tent physiologists, it is probable that th amount of oxygen absorbed in health doe not greatly vary whether the individual is a the sea level or at high altitudes. If this i correct, the accepted belief of increase oxygenation of the blood from breathing a air rich in oxygen, as at the sea level, is no true.
"The effect upon the individual of a ozonized atmosphere is generally concede to be beneficial, yet, unfortunately, less i known upon this subject than is desired;
its antiseptic properties are well recognized,
and its influence upon the purity of the at-
mosphere, if not upon the individual, is un-
doubted. Ozone owes its great influence t its powerful oxydizing qualities. The com-
pounds of ammonia, phosphorus and sul-
phur are acted upon with great rapidity, an the odors resulting from animal decomposi-
tion are removed almost instantly. It i probably destructive to all the minute veg-
etable organisms, when in active develop-
ment, but its effect in destroying the vitalit of their spores has not been yet ascertained This has its direct bearing upon the questio of climate, since it has been pretty well de-
termined that all the varieties of pathogeni microbes not only do not thrive, but fail t live, except within a narrow range of con-
ditions.
"Modern science invests old topics wit new interest. The fundamental factors o sanitation are now so well understood tha the question of climate and its influence upo health and disease may be discussed wit the assurance of dealing somewhat, at least,
with objective factors, instead of theory an the results of experience alone. Every stu-
dent of modern medicine finds a new inspi-

ration from the great progress already mad by the indefatigable labors of a considerabl number of trained workers in all the leadin countries. The one object of research ha been to ascertain the causes of communica-
ble diseases.
"The so-called 'germ theory of disease'
passed from the realm of theory into that o demonstration as fact, and based upon ou present knowledge, confessedly fragmentar and imperfect, yet sufficiently exact fro which to make deductions, sanitation ha become in a large measure a science. Fro this standpoint, climatology is invested wit a new interest and value, as seen especiall in the contributions of the last few years.
A surgically clean wound means an asepti wound. The aphorism of Hippocrates,
'pure air, pure water, pure soil,' signifie now an air, water and soil free from infec-
tious elements of disease, and this must b defined as the most important factor per-
taining to a health resort, sought under th name of climate."
The Virtue of Sanitary Science Much attention of late has been given to coun-
try residences, both by sanitarians aud the trade allied in interest in house construction. Very ex-
tensive observations have been made by Dr. Lucy
M. Hall, who recently delivered a lecture befor the Academy of Anthropology in New York on
"Sanitation in the Country." She has examine over one hundred and fifty country houses in the
East and in the West, aud gives it as her opinio that the country house is not the healthful plac it is usually supposed to be. She has robbe country life of much of the charm with whic people in crowded cities have robed it. A vacatio in the country, according to her opinion, is no assured of the promises of health with which man bent on a summer outing regard it. She has foun disease and death lurking in the vine-clad cottag and in the cool retreats of the shaded dwelling This state of affairs is produced by the ignoranc of hygienic laws and their violation. Among th evils found to exist are improper drainage, uuce-
meuted cellars, failure to ventilate sleeping apart-
ments, exclusive of light, too much shade abou the house, and the improper disposal of kitche refuse It is probably not saying too much to state tha a majority of country houses owe their escap from more continuous and fatal sickness to th free circulation of the air, the cleansing effects o rains, frost and other natural agents, more tha to any regard for sanitary laws. Were the averag of country homes crowded together, and shut ou from the free action of these agents, as in  crowded city, their sanitary condition would be-
come deplorable. Nature abhors disease, and i many ways attempts to remedy tho evils cause by man in the violation of her laws. But th transgressor can go too far. He can trespass to rudely upon her broad benefactions; can weake the hand that extends to him benedictions, an must suffer. Her laws violated and her strengt impaired, artificial means must be resorted to i order to supply the loss. Herein we see the stride made by sanitation; herein we see the lack of i in the country home nestling upon the broa bosom of earth, where nature, uncontaminated,
would be sweet and pure. Man not only pollute nature and weakens her forces, but, through hi indifference and ignorance, makes a habitatio possible only for disease, and bequeaths to pos-
terity a legacy of constitutional ills The report of Dr. Hall does not stop with point-
ing out these evils that a remedy may follow, but,
if only half true, it emphasizes, in a very direc manner, the value of sanitary science as related t the home. Had the science not stepped to th rescue, our crowded cities would have been sufler-
ing from the ills that afflict the country house,
aggravated by almost limitless accumulations We are apt to look upou the architect, engineer,
builder and plumber as so many people engage in solving for themselves the problem of brea and butter, and not as so many agents assisting-
nature in the preservation of life and health. W invito the physician to heal our ills, and shut th door to that science which prevents disease. W rightly' esteem the health officer whose diligenc procures us pure water, but too lightly regard th responsibility resting on the plumber who safel conducts that water polluted by use from ou dwellings Sanitary science has not only made great ad-
vancement, but it has to a marked degree educate maukiud up to a recognition and appreciation o its virtues. Its claims are so well established an accepted that a disregard of its teachings and law can bo considered but little less than a willful ac of criminality.—Sanitary News Diphtheria Contagions The laity must recognize the unanimous an loudly-proclaimed verdict of the medical profes-
sion that at all times and in all cases diphtheria i contagious, and yield a common-sense acquies-
cence in the necessities which impose the isolatio and quarantine of those stricken with the disease Further, they should also refrain from secretin from the disinfecting officers garments aud ma-
terial lately in immediate use about the patient,
and consequently most certainly infected On the medical attendant rests the imperativ duty of inculcating into the minds of the doubtfu the full danger of intercourse, the necessity o proper application of disinfectants to the ejecta,
to tho utensils and other material about the sick,
and also to direct proper inquiry into the sanitar condition of the premises, with suggestions lor th rectilic-ation of apparently existing evils To the sanitary authorities belong the responsi-
bilities of legal correction of illegal violation o sanitary ordinances, the best protection of th neighbors from actual dangers, and the thoroug application of the most certain known disinfect-
ants to infected material compatible with safet to life and property The complete performance of every det ail of thi tripartite duty would surely rapidly diminish th danger, if not entirely remove it. Unfortunately

each of the three factors is wanting in that thor-
oughness of application absolutely essential t success. The laity will readily admit that from  bad case of diphtheria others may follow, but in-
variably the lighter forms of the disease are con-
sidered barren of the dangerous quality of conta-
gion, and even a recognition of the danger will no always deter the curious from braving it, generall to the peril, unfortunately, of an innocent thir party. Concealment of articles lately in the in-
fected room from the disinfecting corps, thus in-
validating any great good which might result fro their work, is another most pernicious practice o the part of the people. In two instances wher this occurred—in one from a shawl and anothe from a blanket secreted—to the children envelope in them diphtheria soon followed in a fatal form Isolation of the sick from other members of th same family, instructions for proper disinfection o material in immediate proximity, and prompt re-
port of the case to the sanitary authorities, tha designative marks may be placed on the house t caution those willing and glad to remain awa from infection, appertain to the duty of the attend-
ing physician. To the credit of a few of our phy-
sicians, some perform this duty well.—New Orleans

"Tho mean barometric for the month has bee somewhat below the normal, while the mean tem-
perature was lowest with the exception of 1882
and 1885, recorded during the past eighteen years The last few day s in the month reduced the tempera-
ture to 26° below the normal. Tbe total rainfal for the month was 5.00 inches, 4.50 of which fel after the 24th. The heaviest rain occurred on the

p. m. both suddenly disappeared. No cold wav signals ordered during the month."
Sergt. L. M. Pindell. U. S. Observer at Chat-
tanooga, makes the following notes:
"The continuous dry spell has proven disas-
trous to crops. The strawberry crops were seriousl damaged; turnips nearly burnt up; potatoes ver small and inferior, the crop being very poor; in fac little or no gardening produce has been successfull raised. Producers on the Ridge, and on east bas of Lookout Mountain, claim that unless rain,
and a plenty of it occurs soon, their entire crop will be ruined, and in consequence, the loss heavy Prom 2.37 a. in. to 9.35 a in. the 30th, 2.55 inche of rain fell. The fall of rain was so great between
3.38 a. m. and 6.40 a. in. that streets and lowland were flooded; streets never known to be floode before, w ere covered in some places from one inc to twenty-threo inches in depth, caused by th sewers not being able to carry off the heavy vol-
ume of water; following this heavy rainfall, was  cold wave. The temperature began to fall Htll.12
a. ui. of the 30th, and at 8 p. m. a fall of 18° wh recorded. The temperature fell rapidly in th afternoon; from 6 p. m. to 8 p. in., a fall of8C.2
was recorded."

ing wind, northwest The observer at Kiddieton makes the followin notes of thunderstorms during the month: "Th thunder and hail storm of the 20th did considerabl damage to fencing and fruit trees, and in washin plowed ground very badly. It was reported to b much more severe in the western and southwester portions of tho county. The rain was mixed wit nail, which packed the plowed ground very hard The hard gusts of winds blew down numbers o trees in this locality. The storm began at 5.50 p.
m. and ended at 7 p. m. Another severe stor was that of the 25th, which began at 2 p. ni. an ended at 5 p. m. ; it came from west southwes with hail also; tho wind was very high and ble down several trees and fences. The hard winds i both these storms lasted but a few minutes, there-
fore no high hourly velocities were recorded. The
Btorm of the 30th was a marked ono on account o the excessive rainfall which followed, 1.26 inc falling in three hours."
The observer at Nunnelly furnishes tho follow-
ing notes on the rain of the 25th: At 9 a. m. the-
wind began blowing in squalls from the southwest,
increasing in volume until 12.15, when smal clouds began rising southwest, which increased i area until noon, 'when dark masses of clouds be-
gan to form from west to north, moving eastward,
with occasional distant thunder. The cloud bega to extend westward and to assume a very dar and threatening appearance. Soudding clouds,
began to form on the upper border of the nimbus,
of a yellowish hue, and move swiftly southeast-
ward. 'When they reached the zenith it becam as dark as twilight, and the rain began falling i torrents. The wind suddenly vecrod to northwest,,
and blew at about 40 miles per hour for 30 sec-

Office State Board of Health,'
Nashville, July 2, 1889 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health:
Sir—Just five years ago your Board did me th honor to elect me to the position of Secretary At that very meeting the first telegraphic new was read announcing the unexpected and violen outbreak of cholera in its most virulent form i a Mediterranean port of France This announcement caused great alarm through-
out Europe, and no small amount of uneasiness in
America, specially in our own interior valley fro the Dominion to the Gulf of Mexico During 1885 and 1886 portions of Italy and
Spain were scourged, and also a few points in
South America However, contrary to all previous history, th plague did not spead over Europe, nor did it visi the United States This fact attracted, of course, very wide notice,
and everywhere an explanation was demanded Only one solution cciild be found. Whereas,
in 1832, 1849, 1866, 1873, this disease was allowe to take it? own course, no effort in most case whatever being made to prevent its entrance, o this occasion exactly the opposite plan was pur-
sued.
A few years back the entire machinery of stat preventive medicine Was unknown. In 1884 most/
European and American governments maintaine national, state and city boards of health, mor or less efficiently. Hence and hence alone th difference. Those portion^, of Southern Europ were ravaged where scientific sanitation was no only neglected but really unknown. Its sprea from these regions where it caused untold misery,
terror and mortality during three years into th rest of Europe was prevented by prompt, scientifi and humane quarantine measures relating to com-
munities, and by rigid isolation and disinfection o of individual cases occurring outside of infecte districts It got into Brazil and Chili because of gros violation of sanitary axioms. It avoided the
United States because of the strict observance o those axioms As a consequence the value and merit of board of health, and of sanitary regulations faithfull carried out, have been greatly enhanced in publi estimation. The grand lesson has been learne that epidemics do not move with irresitible fury This is a great gain, of inestimable value to th public peace, comfort and safety. I know that

this is so in Tennessee, for previously to this las splendid demonstration of sanitary progress th words Asiatic cholera always evoked images o desolation and dismay in the minds of the thou-
sands who had gone through the experience o the four previous epidemics Since 1884 the experience with small-pox an yellow fever has also taught our people the grea lesson that epidemic diseases need not prevail;
and that their very prevalence is proof conclusiv of gross and culpable neglect on the part of ruler somewhere This lesson will not be lost. Typhoid fever,
diphtheria and scarlet fever will soon be in th category of diseases which should be prevented Each case will be minutely studied, its origin as-
certained and its causation of other cases ob-
structed by thorough isolation and disinfection In all this line of work progress is the rule in
Tennessee, noticeable at all events, though not s rapid and satisfactory as in those of our sister
States which have furnished full equipment fo work to their sanitary officials Looking at the very slender means placed by th wealthy and populous State of Tennessee at th disposal of its board of health, I cannot avoid th conviction that wit hin the past five years a remark-
able work has been accomplished by it. A mont ago I had a growling report in composition becaus of dwelling upon the manifold deficiencies in ou large cities and beautiful villages. But returnin from an inspection of some of the oldest an wealthiest portions of the Union, I am rather as-
tonished that Tennessee is so wide-awake as it i to-day. Like progress in another five years wil place it in an advanced position, of which all Ten-
nesseans may justly be proud Just four years ago, the board, after mature de-
liberation, decided to devote about one-third of it small annual appropriation to the publication an distribution of a monthly Bulletin so as to reac every locality of and every interest in the State This plan has been carefully and systematicall worked out. Some months 5.000 copies hav been circulated; in no month less than 2.000 These go regularly to all persons who pay th small subscription of twenty-five cents annually,
to all newspapers and other periodicals in Tennes-
see, to a large exchange list outside the State an to special lists at home and abroad as occasio may demand. Nothing is sent out from the offic of this board, helter-skelter. In all cases record are kept, so that we know whether or not labo and money is wasted Thus far the value of this publication is demon-
strated. At least seven other States have followe our example. v Exchanges from every part of Ten-
nessee and from all portions of the Union give u valuable sources of information, and enable us t make Tennessee well and favorably known as a
State eminently adapted to the best class of immi-
grants from the malarial South or the arctic
North The Bulletin has awakened much interest i many localities for better sanitation. Thus a foun-
dation for rapid and enduring practical work ha been laid by you, which will enable the board t make great progress in its highest and most endur-
ing lines right away. And here much is to be done Nashville and Memphis, through their municipa authorities, do not sufficiently back their healt officers, Chattanooga is asleep, Knoxville is awa behind the times, our smaller cities and towns al need more efficient sanitation The cheering fajt, however, prevails, that th people are ahead of their rulers and will soon re-
place them by more faithful servants The following additions have been made to th library duriug the quarter:

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Sims be appointed a delegate to the National
Prison Association, to be held in Nashville The term of Dr. Wright having expire he was, upon motion of Dr. Sims, unani-
mously recommended to the Governor fo reappointment After examination of accounts and ap-
proval of the same, the Board adjourned t meet on Tuesday, October ist An Opportunity Elsewhere in this issue we reproduce a editorial and open letter from Robert P Porter, Superintendent of Census, to th medical profession, which we extract from
The Drugman. No copy of this letter wa received by fhe State Board of HealrVi The subject—vital statistics—is one whic this Board has been deeply interested i since its organization, but which tip to no they have failed in inducing the Legislatur to adopt for the State a permanent syste regarding. Here is an opportunity, how-
ever, to do the next best thing, and w would therefore, urge every county an municipal health officer to interest himsel in this matter, and at once, dhd by timel agitations of the subject-*-through the loca press and otherwise—arouse the practition-
ers of medicine in their respective district to the full appreciation of the opportunit thus offered, and the importance of eac one doing what he can to make the re-
turns asked for as full and accurate as possi-
ble. The single fact, that we have np Stat law in Tennessee upon vital statistics, shoul be reason enough, that this effort, both as i pertains to the medical profession in the
State, as weil as to the census officials, shoul be more than ordinarily thorough; and i that connection we would call attention t the fact, that the "Physician's Registers"
which Mr. Porter in his letter proposed t send out during the month of May last t the medical profession, have not, sb far a we have information, been received in Ten-
nessee up to this writing. This omissio should be promptly supplied Regions in West Tennessee of Sulphur Water and Chalybeate Waters, Respectively—The Lin of Division Between the Two Regions—The Ori-
gin of Iron Ore By J. M. SAFFORD, Ph. D. Chairman of Committee on Water Supply In considering the wells, springs and streams o the western division of the State as to the charac-
ter of the waters they supply, we must at the out-
set recognize the fact that West Tennessee i divided into two very unequal portions by a re-
markable line running north and south, known as
"The Old Shore Line." To the east of this ar hard rocks, limestones, shales and flinty layers,
such as belong to Middle Tennessee, and of whic indeed they are the extreme western extension an terminus; while to the west, spreading over a.
great area, are beds of little indurated sands an clays. This line, or ancient shore, for such it is,
lies in general a little to the west of the Tennesse river, the two being approximately parallel. No-
where does it coincide with the bed of the Ten-
nessee, excepting for a diftance of about eightee miles in Hardin county. Along this portion of th fiver are Pittsburg landing, Savannah and Coffe landing. Passing the latter landing and going-
northward, the Old Shore and the river no longe coincide. The Old Shore passes just west of I)e-
caturville, in Decatur county, and of Camden and
Big Sandy station, in Benton. These places may,
in fact, be considered as located on the Shore From Big Sandy station it bends more to the east,
approaching, in Henry county, within two mile of the Mouth of Sandy and Paris landings. Thenc its direction is parallel with the river to the Ken-
tucky boundary If we compare the formations of the two por-
tions of country separated by this Old Shore Line,
including their respective concomitants, rocks,
minerals, soils, etc., the contrasts are seen to b very marked. "We have here to do with the wa-
ters. On the east, from the limestone and shales,
the springs are " sulphur," or have limestone hard-
ness; on the west they are chalybeate, or else sof and freestone. Such is the jule. There are excep-
tions, as might be expected. The exceptions o the west arise from the occurrence of two specia formations—earthy strata, rich in limy matter,
the waters of which will be considered below What is true of springs is true of wells and o the smaller streams. Some of the larger stream in the matter of water follow the rule; others,
draining areas lying on both sides of the Shor line, supply water of mised or modified character.
A few examples of springs and Wells, fro among many that could be enumerated, will serve

to illustrate the differences referred to. East o the Shore line, and out of limestones chiefly, th following sulphur waters may be mentioned:
The •'Bed Sulphur" and the " White Sulphur"
of Hardin county, two distinct but neighborin springs, near the Tennessee river, on its wester side, and but little north of the Mississippi line The sites of both of these were improved befor the war and were pleasant, popular places The "Artesian Well" of the northern part of
Hardiu county, originally bored for salt water, an located at a point half a mile north of White Oak
Tiver, and about a mile aud a half west of the
Tennessee. A large stream of water issues wit considerable force from this well.
"Bath Springs," in the southern part of Decatu county, is another point well known for its sulphu water. It was once a place of resort, is abou seven miles northwest from Clifton, on the roa leading from Lexington and Jackson The noted "Artesian Well" of Henry county,
near the bottom of the Big Sandy river, and nin miles from its mouth. This, like the artesian wel of fl ardin, was bored for salt water, the boring i both cases being several hundred feet in limeston rock. The boring in the Henry well is some 400
feet deep, and yields a great flow of water—enoug to turn a small mill. This has been a place o great resort, and is now to a limited extent. Bot this and the artesian well of Hardin are temporarily
■covered with back-water from the Tennessee, whe the latter is in flood It would be easy to multiply examples. I d not hesitate to designate the portion of West Ten-
nessee east of the Old Shore as the sulphur wate belt Passing to the west of the Old Shore, sulphu water disappears, and chalybeate takes its place In contrast with what has been given, the follow-
ing springs and wells, a few taken from many, are
•enumerated. The range of those selected is no far west of the dividing Shore liuo.
"The Dunlaj) Chalybeate Springs," about tw and a half miles south of Bolivar. These suppl abundant water, are located in a grove of hug forest trees, in a cool valley or cove, surrounde by hills, all making a retreat of most attractive
■character, well frequented by the good people of
Bolivar and their friends, ailing or not.
"Bethel Springs," a station on the Mobile <fc
■Ohio railroad, in McNairy county. A spring sup-
plies a free flow of delightful chalybeate that lon before the railroad was thought of was resorted t by invalids and others for its curative powers.
"Mason's Wells," in Madison county. A group
■of three wells, oue a bored well, with improve-
ments, located at a poiut eleven miles from Jack-
son, on the Jackson and Jack's Creek road, als about three miles, air-line, north of northwest from
Pinsou, a station on the Mobile <fc Ohio railroad,
and one mile from the Chester county line. The
"wolls" have long been famous for their medica virtues, and are a Mecca for those of the surround-
ing regions burdened with ills, fancied or real Tho principal well is 70 feet deep, with 30 feet o water, which is very moderately chalybeate an slightly astringent. The water reminds one o that of the Gibson Wells, which hold a high plac in public favor The Chalybeates of Carroll county, around Hunt-
ingdon. These are in profusion, there being man of them in the bottom near the town. Some hav formed low mounds of ferric oxide or ooze aroun them, in which a small unwary animal migh easily mire and be lost. The people of Hunting-
don enjoy them, and here and there one, in th cool shade of the great trees of the bottom, is th centre of a delightful picnic and dancing ground.
A short distance south of the town is an artesia chalybeate, from the pipe of which is a great flo of clear, sparkling and refreshing water. A hote was built here some years ago for the reception o summer visitors, but for some reason it proved  failure—certainly not for lack of mineral water o choice character and in abundance Chalybeate in Henry county. A few miles eas of Paris, in low, swampy ground, through whic the Louisville & Memphis railroad runs, are sev-
eral chalybeate springs, supplying good cool wa-
ter. At one of these, very near the track, a trai will sometimes, in a hot summer day, stop for  supply, much to the gratification of the hot, thirst passengers. More removed from the track of th road, but in the same region, is a noted spring,
free flowing and highly palatable. From Paris t this spring is a favorite drive and often made The chalybeates here given may be considere typical of the waters of tho springs and wells i the portion of West Tennessee west of the shor line. This portion is the region of chalybeat water It would be interesting to discuss the genesis,
on the one hand, of the eastern sulphur water,
and, on the other, that of the western chalybeates This we may do hereafter, and only remark her as to the latter that the presence of changin organic vegetable matter iu the soft rocks, thos west of the Shore, aud of comparatively recen origin, has determined the character of the water The decomposing matter has deoxidized the highe oxide of iron, converting it into the lower oxide,
and has at the same time supplied the acid (car-
bonic) to convert this lower oxide into iron car-
bonate. As a second step, the water, charged

■with an excess of carbonic acid, has dissolved thi iron carbonate, thereby making itself chalybeate.
"We might go on and slate that so soon as th chalybeate water comes to the free air, the proces above is in a measure reversed; the water loses it excess of carbonic acid; the carbonate is precipi-
tated and decomposed, and the lower oxide o iron oxidized into the higher. In this way, throug the action of organic matter and water, the iro oxide widely diffused through the sands and clay is taken up, made soluble, then deposited as oxid ooze about the mouths of tho springs, to becom in the end, indeed, hard iron ore. Many of ou iron ore beds, where now no chalybeate water i found, have been formed in just such a way Glanders in Gibson County Under date of June 28, 1889, Dr. T. J Happel, County Health Officer of Gibson
County, made the following report to the
County Court:
"I would respectfully present the following re-
port in regard to the existence of glanders amon the stock in the fourth and fifth districts of you county:
•'As reported to you at tho April term of th court, the existence of glanders among the horse and mules of Joe Watt, of the fourth district,
was rumored. You saw fit, as a County Court, t take no official action in regard to the matter fur-
ther than to advise quarantining, etc. Early in
June the existence of the disease became noto-
rious, and about the middle of the month Dr Ford, a veterinary surgeon from Jackson, whils in this county, examined Mr. Watt's stock an reported two undoubted cases in mules on hi place. This fact, through the livery interests of
Humboldt and Jackson, was reported to the Gov-
ernor and State Board of Health, as well as t myself. The State Board of Health at once ad-
dressed a letter to the County Board of Health of
Gibson County, urging prompt action to destro said stock and disinfect stables, etc.
"On the 18th of June, whilst in Nashville o business, 1 called on the President of the State
Board of Health and discussed the situation wit him.
"All cases of glanders that have occurred i these districts named have been directly or indi-
rectly traced to one common origin. There ar said to bo other cases of the disease yet existin in the neighborhood, but when it is "known tha such diseased stock is to be killed, it will soon b difficult to find them all. One other case ha already been reported to me, but as yet I hav had no time to investigate it. On the 23d ult. I
visited and examined Mr. Watt's stock, consistin of two mules and one horse. He had had thro mules, but about a week before my visit one of th diseased mules had become so decrepit and offen-
sive that he had it killed and thrown into a ditch An examination of the stock showed one mule,
which had been quarantined from the others, wit a well marked case of the glanders, just enterin the last stage of the disease. I made arrange-
ments and had that mule killed, with tho consen of Mr. Watt, the next day at the same place wher the carcass of the other mule lay, and had bot animals burned. A bill for the killing and burnin is on your table to-day. The horse owned by Mr Watt showed not a trace of the disease, and th remaining mule showed but one enlarged glan that could excite any suspicion. Mr. Watt wa notified to tear down and burn the old stable i which the diseased mules had at times been kept,
and to disinfect, lime, clean, etc., his new stable The new stable has been attended to, but up to
Friday the old one had not been removed. A the County Board of Health had heretofore passe no rules concerning such matters when the cas arose, it would possibly be proper to compensate
Mr. Watt for the stable, or at least to pay fo pulling down and burning.
"AU cases of diseases of a contagious natur among stock should be promptly reported to the
County Board of Health, so that they could b looked after promptly."
In letter dated July 3d and received from
Dr. Happel, he says:
"In report 1 made to the County Court, a con of which was forwarded you, you will see I lai the facts regarding the existence of glanders in
Gibson County fully before them. I also read t the court the rules about glanders adopted, a cop of which appears below, and in a short talk to th court 1 attempted to impress the importance o eradicating at once the disease, and asked them t adopt as their own the rules. I advised the pay-
ment of half value for the stock destroyed. Al these things the court did, so that, thus far. ther is no trouble. I hope before the October term o the court to root out all cases of the disease i the county."
"At a meeting of the County Board of Healt of Gibson County, held this day in Trenton,
Tenn., the following rules and regulations wer adopted:
'• 1. Tt shall be unlawful fur any one knowingl to keep any stock affected with glanders. An one violating this rule shall be arrested by an officer, under a warrant sworn out by any citize of Gibson county, carried before any convenien magistrate, and upon conviction fined from $2.50
to $10.00 for each and every offense.
'• 2. It shall be the duty of any party or partie owning any stock having glanders, when notifie by the County Board of Health, at once to kill o cause to be killed said stock and to bum their dea bodies, or bury them to the depth of at least si feet in the ground, covering them with uuslacke lime before covering them with dirt. Any viola-
tion of this rule shall be punishable as in Rule 1,

Vital Statistics in the Next Census The newly appointed Superintendent of the
Census, Robert P. Porter, has already begun th preliminary work of inakiug, if possible, the cen-
sus of 1890, in respect to accuracy aud fullness,
■without a parallel in this country. To be success-
ful in this great undertaking, it will bo necessar that all shall help. Below we reprint a circula letter from him, addressed to the medical profes-
sion in the United States, which explains itself Naturally vital statistics are given preference i being thus lirst considered, as in their applicatio they possess a direct personal value to the people,
which is more immediate and far-reaching in im-
portance. Notwithstanding this fact, vital statis-
tics in this country have uniformly in the pas been, by long odds, the most difficult to obtain,
and Id each successive effort of the Government i this direction, this subdivision of the census stand out conspicuous in its incompleteness The want of uniformity of legislation in those
States of the Onion which have systems of vita statistics, and the entire want of legislation upo the subject in other States—as, for instance, in
Tennessee—give to such statistics in Americ naturally but little scientific value, and, as a con-
sequence, the subject becomes to us as a people  standing reproach by all the more enlightene nations of the world. Now, it is to correct thi state of affairs, as far as under our system of gov-
ernment a national census can do so, that Mr Porter in his circular lettnr earnestly solicits th individual and collective aid of that professio which, more than any other, has cognizauce of th matter of births and deaths We sincerely hope the medical profession of th country will extend to the full the assistanc asked, and with proper enthusiasm will enter a once upon the work as thus outlined by the Super-
intendent of Census of 1890.—The Druijman Department ok the Interior,
Census Office, Washington, May 1, 1889 To the Medical Profession:
The various medical associations and the medi-
cal profession will be glad to learn that Dr. John
S. Billings, Surgeon IT. S. Army, has consented t take charge of the Report on the Mortality and
Tital Statistics of the United States as returne by the eleventh census Ah the United States has no system of registra-
tion of vital statistics, such as is relied upon b other civilized nations for the purpose of ascertain-
ing the actual movement of population, our censu affords tho only opportunity of obtaining near a approximate estimate of the birth and death rate of much tho larger part of the country, which i entirely unprovided with any satisfactory syste of State and municipal registration In view of this, the census office during th month of May this year will issue to the medica profession throughout the country "Physician's
Registers," for the purpose of obtaining more accu-
rate returns of deaths than it is possible for th enumerators to make. It is earnestly hoped tha physicians in every part of the country will aid th census olfiee in this important work. The recor should be kept from Juue 1, 1889, to May 31, 1890 Xearly 26,000 of these registration blanks wer filled up and returned to the office in 1880, an nearly all of them used for statistical purposes It is hoped that double this number will be ob-
tained for the eleventh census Physicians not receiving registers can obtai them by sending their names aud addresses to th census office, aud, with tho register, an officia envelope which requires no stamp will be provide for their return to Washington If all medical and surgical practitioners through-
out the country will lend their aid, the mortalit and vital statistics of the eleventh ceusus will b more comprehensive and complete than they hav ever been. Every physician should take a per-
sonal pride iu having this report as full and accu-
rate as it is possible to make it It is hereby promised that all information ob-
tained through this source shall be held strictl confidential. Rouert P. Porter,
Superintendent of Census.
A New Deodorant Bromine has lor a long time been recognized a being valuable in the treatment of gangrene an foul-smelling ulcers, but uutil recently its merit as an effectual and cheap deodorant have not bee appreciated. It was brought into prominence  few months ago by Mr. Martin, the chemist o the health department of this city, who suggeste its use upon the earth thrown up in laying th electric subways. As it is a by-product obtaine in the manufacture of salt, and is not used exten-
sively in the arts, it is sold at a very reasonabl price—about seventy cents per pound. It ha the property of precipitating the hydrocarbons o illuminating gas, and thus can be used to deodoriz the earth exposed in excavations in the vicinity o gas-mains. More valuable than this is its effec upon decomposing organic bodies, which it ren-
ders completely inoffensive. This property ren-
ders it particularly valuable for use in stables,
privy vaults, urinals, cess-pools, or in any plac which may contain foul-smelling organic matters It is soluble iu about thirty-three parts of water,
but a solution of this strength is not advisable, a there is a constant escape from it of the vapor o bromine, which is very irritating to the eyes an air-passages, and which may even attack woo and metals. For ordinary purposes it is used i solutions containing one part by weight to abou eight hundred of water. In this strength it ma be used freely without its affecting anything whic it may touch. A fn\v gallons used daily will re-
move all amoniacal odors from stables, or a fe quarts will thoroughly deodorize the entire plumb-
ing system of an ordinary house. It also might

be used with advantage upon ordinary hous garbage, which usually becomes offensive so speed-
ily in warm weather. There would appear to b scarcely any limit to its usefulness in this branc of sanitary science, and it will, as its merits ar better known, undoubtedly be adopted universall as a substitute for the deodorants now in use,
which usually act by substituting one unpleasan odor for another. The only drawback in its us lies in the fact that the undiluted bromine i strongly corrosive, and if it touches the ski causes a painful burn. Where it is used in larg quantities this can be obviated by opening th bottle, or, what is simpler, breaking it unde water. As its use becomes more extended it wil undoubtedly be put up in pearls or tubes contain-
ing only as much as would be needed at one tim in the average household.—N. Med. Jour Sir Bdwin Chadwick, in an address on sanitar science, says: "Physicians are beginning to de-
clare that a large amount of the crime for whic punishment is inflicted is due to insanity, and tha insanity is due to low physical condition whic sanitation by early physical training would re-
move. Thore are experiences to show that this i the fact. Dr. Ashe and others conversant wit the lunatic asylum declare that, as a class, luna-
tics are of low physical condition, and that lo condition is reducible by sanitation and earl physical training. Of thirty thousand blind per-
sons, the late Dr. Rolph declared that two-third might have been saved by early sanitation."
A Safe Cordial It is true that milk heated to much above 100
degrees Fahrenheit loses for a time, in a slight de-
gree, its sweetness and density But no one who, fatigued by over-exertion o body and mind, has ever experienced the rovivin influence of a tumbler of this beverage, heated a warm as it can be sipped, and with or without  teaspoonful of sugar, will willingly forego a resor to it because of its being rendered somewhat les acceptable to the palate The promptness with which its cordial influenc is felt is indeed surprising. Some portion of i seems to be digested and appropriated almost im-
mediately, aud many who now fancy they nee alcoholic stimulants when exhausted by fatigu will find iu this simple draught an equivalent tha will be abundantly satisfying, and far more endur-
ing in its effects. There is many an ignorant,
over-worked woman who faucies she could no keep up without her beer. She mistakes th momentary exhilaration for strength, aud applie the whip instead of nourishment to her poor, ex-
hausted frame. Any honest, intelligent physicia will tell her that there is more real strength an nourishment in a slice of bread than iu a (mart o beer; but if she loves stimulants it would he  very useless piece of information. It is claime that some of the lady clerks in our own city, an these, too, who are employed in respectable busi-
ness houses, have been in the habit of ordering al or beer from the restaurants. They probably clai that they are "tired"—aud no one who sees thei faithful devotion to customers all day will doub their assertions. But they should not mistak beer for a blessiug, or stimulus for strength. A
careful examination of statistics will prove tha men and women who do not drink can endur more hardships, and do more work, aud live longer,
than those less temperate.—Bulletin R. I. State
Board of Health Inebriate Asylums Dr. T. D. Crothers, of Eartford, Conn., in a address on " Inebriate Asylums and Their Work."
delivered at Toronto, Can., draws the followin conclusions as being supported by the latest teach-
ings of science and experience: 1. Inebriate hos-
pitals must take the place id'jails and station-
houses. Such places are dangerous in their menta and physical surroundings, by intensifying the de-
generation, and removing the patient beyond hop of recovery. They are in many cases litera training-stations for mustering iu armies of chroni maniacs that never desert or leave the ranks unti crushed out forever. 2. Inebriate hospitals shoul receive the incurable inebriates, and make the self-supporting, and build them up physically an mentally. They would relieve the tax-payer, an relieve society of untold burdens of sorrow an misery. 3. Inebriate hospitals should receive th recent cases, and place them iu the highest condi-
tions of enforced health and vigor, and thus retur a large number to health and sobriety again. 4 Inebriate hospitals can and should be self-support ing when once established. They should be man-
aged on scientific business principles, like militar training-schools. 5. Inebriate hospitals should b built from the money raised by taxes on the sal of spirits, on the priuciple that every busines should be obliged to provide for the accident which grow out of it. 6. These are the realitie which every inebriate hospital is approaching, an which all experience points out as practical an literal in the near future. 7. The inebriate hos-
pitals of to-day are only in the infancy of thei work, contending with great opposition and preju-
dice, misunderstood, condemned, and workin against innumerable obstacles. 8. The work o the present inebriate hospitals, notwithstandin all the difficulties and imperfections, has the grand-
est promise for the future, aud encouragement fo further effort in this field, along the line of scien-
tific research. 9. Lastly, there is an intense per-
sonality in inebriate hospitals to each one of us They may bring salvation and restoration to som one near and dear. Tbey may be fountains o healing whose influence shall cross and influenc our pathway iu many ways. 10. Inebriate hos-
pitals and their work are the great new land whic only a few settlors have reached. They are call-
ing to us to come up aud occupy, and thus hel the race on in the great march from the lower t the higher.—Science Cremation Des Moines, la., has a crematory for the cit refuse which cost only $1,700. As an indicatio of its effectiveness, there was at one time recentl burned in it, in one hour, two dead horses, seve dogs, eighteen barrels of garbage, three hods o manure, fifteen bushels of rotten eggs, and thre barrels of rotten fish, aud no offensive smell wa emitted.—Ex.

Microbic Longevity To the literature of this subject I venture th following contribution:
Thirty-five years ago an opulent family lived i a palatial home in one of our most beautiful sub-
urbs. Two lovely children graced the happ household. liut scarlet fever, that fell foe o childhood, closed their eyes in death. The grief-
stricken mother gathered up little slips, slippers
.and toys with two golden tresses, and reverentl laid them away in a trunk as sad but priceles mementoes of her lost darlings War came with its tragic vicissitudes, and deat time and again threw its shadow over the hearth-
stone Finally the place passed into stranger hands Last year two families took it as a summer resi-
dence The children, six in number, with childish curi-
osity, begau to explore the secret recesses of th grand old house. In a closet was found the for-
gotten trunk. A touch dissolved the time-corrode clasp, and one by one the sacred relics were re-
moved, until a faded newspaper was found, whic told the pathetic story. Half spelling out th meaning, they took it to their mother, who chrde their curiosity, and tenderly replaced the treas-
ures Five days after this occurrence two of .the chil-
dren were seized with scarlet fever, and forty-
eight hours later the other four were attacked Two cases were grave, the others mild. All re-
covered Was the disease contracted from the trunk? I
think so, because there was no other ascertainabl source of infection Moral: Silks, woolen and hair, being good fomi-
ties, should not be put away in air-tight trunks a mementoes of friends dying with infectious dis-
eases, because they may become, at some remot period, the starting point of a wide-spreading an disastrous epidemio, a calamity which was averte in this instance only by complete isolation.—T. A Atchison, M. D Electric Lights Indoors Theoretically there is a great advantage in close rooms in using electric light instead of gas light,
and practically it has been found in the Postomce
Central Savings Bank in London, that during th past two years, since the introduction of the elec-
trio lights into the building, there has been  marked decrease in the amount of time lost fro sickness by the clerks and employees. They ge rid of the undesirable products of combustio which accompany the use of gas lights, and the therefore have a pure air to breathe.—The Sanitary
Inspector Attend to the Streets The midsummer work of clearing sidewalks an gutters of weeds that was begun last week was  judicious expenditure of a little of the city's funds.
A comely and comfortable condition of the street of a town impress all whose impressions are wort anything mightily in favor of the thrift of the in-
habitants. Good streets are in the nature of  first-class advertisement of a town. On the othe hand, ragged, unkept streets are a sign of deteri-
oration, or a betrayal of poverty that has neve been taken plate of by something better. Loo to your streets and your fences, and thus mak sure of the good opinion of strangers who com within the gates of the city.—Dayton News Florida Board of Health Northern owners of real estate in Florida ex-
press much gratification over the creation of a
State Hoard of Health for that State. The boar is well equipped, with almost unlimited powers,
and an ample appropriation. Had such a hoar been created two years ago, Jacksonville woul not have suffered as she did last year from yello fever. Florida has long been in need of an abl and vigilant State Board of Health.—Sanitary
Volunteer Results of Vaccination The opponents of vaccination in England hav of late been more active than ever; and, as a re-
sult of their activity, a royal commissioner ha been appointed, whose duty it shall be to make  full investigation of the whole subject, and snb-
mit a report theieon. Friends of vaccinatio should welcome such an inquiry, as the metho stands upon such a firm foundation of facts as t be able to stand the most searching examination If it has not accomplished all that is claimed fo it, the failure is due to insufficient or inefficien performance of the operation, and the sooner suc abuse of it is made public the better. It is  rather remarkable coincidence that just at thi time events should transpire at Sheffield, England,
which show the value of vaccination. Small-po has recently been very prevalent in that city. I a population of about 320,000 there have been
6,088 cases of tho disease, of which number 590
proved fatal. Dr. Barry, who has made a repor to the local government board, finds that the at-
tack-rate of the vaccinated children under ten wa five in a thousand; of the unvaccinated of th same age, 101 in a thousand. The death rates fo the same classes were respectively .09 and 44. I every hundred thousand of those twice vaccinate there were eight deaths; once vaccinated, 100
deaths; and unvaccinated, 5,100 deaths.—Science To Detect Lead in Water Place two perfectly bright and clean knitting-
needles in a glass nearly full of the water to b tested, and add eight or ten drops of acetic acid,
or a teaspooufnl of vinegar. The needles shoul be carefully revolved occasionally. If lead b present, dark or black spots will soon appear upo the needles, and in six or eight hours they will b covered with a gray coating, the depth of color o which will depend upon the amount of lead in th fluid. A magnifying glass may be used, if neces-
sary. Where the amount of lead is exceedingl small, the deposit may not be immediately detect-
ed, but after standing for twenty-four hours be-
comes yellow.—National Druggist.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Ice Water There is a great deal of sentiment and man opinions regarding the use of ice water that vanis when the light of reason and experience is turne upon them. The fact is, that ice water, dran slowly and in moderate quantities, constitutes  healthful and invigorating drink. There is n doubt that ice is a great sanitary agent, and ever family ought to be provided with it during th warmer months of the year. It is true that th inordinate use of ice water, or its use under som special conditions and circumstances, is attende with great danger; so is the improper use of an other drink or food. The assumption that ice water is dangerous, and that iced tea, or ice coffee, or iced lemonade is a harmless substitute i simply a delusion. As the source of danger feare by some is the degree of cold, we fail to see clearl how the flavor modifies the effect of temperature There are some individuals, undoubtedly, who ca not drink ice water without injury, and who ough never to use it, but to a great majority of person it is refreshing and healthful. Its use, temperat and discreet, is in no way to be condemned, whic cannot be said of some of its substitutes.—Sani-
tary Volunteer.
A Sanitary Truth What a good thing it would be if the city coul afford to have all the pestiferous weeds cut down If the omuiverous hog was grateful for publi favors, he would show his gratitude by keepin the streets clean of weeds, anyway. But the hog,
like the politician, is never grateful. The most h does is walking the sidewalks and paying his toll.

tery, diarrhoea and cholera infantum were quit prevalent during the month, but not ot a ver severe type Gibson county. Dr. T. J. Happel, County
Health Officer, Trenton. For the month of June
I can report no sickness of any note. A few case of remittent fever, responding readily to quinine,
and one case of pneumonia would cover the firs half of the month. In tho last week of the mont dysenteric troubles predominated. The cases, a a rule, could easily be traced to eating fruit o vegetables. The greater portion of my time, sinc the 18th ult. has been devoted to the question o glanders among horses and mules in this county—
a report of which will be found in full elsewher in this Bulletin Milan. M. D. L. Jordan, M. D. Sporadi causes of dysentery have been noted in town an country.

a few cases of summer complaint among children,
bilious fever, etc. Whatever the disease, the out-
cropping* of the bilious diathesis has been visible Hardeman county. Dr. Jas. J. Neely, Jr.,

June was exceptionally healthy—less sicknes than was ever known here in this month before,
though there is a slight tendency to bowel affec-
tions of a dysenteric character. Dr. Dorris, in th northeastern and most elevated portion of th county, in the pine hills, reports more sicknes than any physician in tho county. Typhoid for of malarial fever has been in that neighborhoo since last. fall Hardin county. Dr. J. K. Barlow, County

The observer at Riddleton makes the followin notes for the month: The monthly mean baromete was about normal, and there were no very hig nor low readings recorded. The temperature was
2°.2 below the 7-year normal, and the maximu was not so high as usual. The early part of th month was cool and the latter was not as warm a usual in June. The rainfall was above normal,
0.69. The greater portion fell in the period fro the 9th to the 20th, Inclusive; enl}'one day fre from precipitation out of a period of twelve!
"While the excessive rain damaged the wheat crop,
it had a beneficial effect on oats and tobacco. Th average cloudiness was greatly in excess, 5.4, an the number of rainy days ways also in excess b one-half The observer at Spfingdale notes as follows con-
cerning crops: Meadows extra f*ie; corn look weM, wheat good; oats much better than ex-
pected; pastures ffne; Irish potatoes extra; appl crop heavy; poaches about half a crop The observer at Florence Station makes the fol-
lowing notes: Mean temperature, 71°.92, 3°.08
loss than the averase temperature of June for si years, 1883- to 1888, inclusive. Rainfall, 4.64
inches, 0.47 inch less than the average for June,
1883, to 1888, inclusiva; total rainfall January 1s to June 30th, inclusive. 22.93 inches; deficiency,
2.33 inches. The average rainfall for July ha been 3.44 inches The observer at Rugby reports that during th heavy storm of the 16th a house was struck b lightning The observer at Dunlap reports that during th storm of the night of the 13th a residence wa struck by lightning; no one injured The observer at Ashwood says: Very we month: rain fell more or less on twelve consecu-
tive days, from 9th to 20th; not much fell at thi ststion, but in the immediate vicinity rain fell i heavy showers nearly every day The observer at Nunnelly furnished the follow-
ing notes for the month: Some of the phenomena features of June were the excess of rainfall, whic amounted to 5.31 inches, which fell on sixtee days, and the continuous cloudiness which almos suspended evaporation and caused the lands to b too wet for tillage up to the last week in th month. It has been comparatively calm durin the month; moderately high winds on the Sth and
16th. Electric disturbance has been largely i excess, almost daily throughout the month. A earthquake on the 5th at 9 p. m., accompanied, b a rumbling sound. The vibrations were distinctly-
felt, lasting 15 or 20 seconds; direction fro which it came was not noted. The force was s great as to nearly overturn burning lamps in th second story of buildings. On the 13th at 4 p. m.
a very bright rainbow, forming a complete arc an reaching from horizon to horizon, all the tints i their brightest eojprs being distinctly defined The left hand base seemed to rest against a fores three-quarters of a mile away, the green fores leaves presenting a pleasant contrast to the varie tints of the rainbow. On the 1st at 9 to 11.30 a.
m. a very brilliant and well defined halo, 24°
diameter, in three distinct colors, the outer pur white, the next a bright yellow, and the inner  bright red The observer at Riddleton furnishes the follow-
ing notes concerning the hail storm of the 3d in
Smith County: The hail storm oT the 3d was th heaviest that has visited this section since th establishment of this station. It was especiall severe in the northwest portion of Smith County The corn crop was damaged to a great extent, th hail stripping all the blades off in places, an beating the stalk down fiat with the ground. Sev-
eral large crops were utterly ruined; had to b plowed up and replanted. The wheat crop fare equally as^bad, the hail stones beating down th stalks and shattering the heads Oats did no suffer so severely, because of younger growth, bu the crop was beaten down to some extent. Frui trees wero stripped of their leaves and most of th fruit, and all trees, vines, weeds and other vegeta-
tion received a full share of the stortn. Ten day later, as seen from the river, the former green,
spring luxuriance was changed to a brownish yel-
low, giving all vegetation a.desolate appearance The storm began at 2 p. m. ahid ended at 4 p. m.;
the hail began at 3 p. m. and ended at 3.15 p. m The size of the stones wero reported to be one-
half to three-quarters of an inch in diameter Sergt. J. B. Marbury, U. S. Observer at Nash-
ville, makes the following notes for month: Th first two days of tho month were remarkably cool

for the season, bringing into requisition discarde clothing and causing tires to be rekindled durin the early morning and at night. The averag temperature for the month was 1° above the low-
est mean for June during the past eighteen years,
while the pressure ranged al>out normal. Th total rainfall, 5.33 inches, is slightly in excess o the normal for June at this station Sergt. L. M. Pindell, U. S. Observer at Chatta-
nooga, gives the data of rainfall for the month a stations outside the State: Murphy, N. C, 6.48
inches; Charleston, N. C, 3.79 inches; ABbeville,
K*. C, 4 51 inches The following is the data for the month of Ma at Tullahoma, the report having been received to late for tabulation: mean temperature, 66°.2;
mean of maximum temperature, 74°.7; mean o minimum temperature. 61°. 1; highest tempera-
ture, 85°, on the 17th and 18th; lowest tempera-
ture, 39°, on the 30th; range of temperature, 46°;
mean daily range, 12°.8; total rainfall, 2.41 inches;
mean daily rainfall, 0.078 inch; greatest rainfal in 24 hours, 0.98 inch, on the 19th; number o clearways. 22; fair days, 7; cloudy days, 2; day of rainfall, 6; prevailing wind, south Observations at Grief and Fostoria, which hav been suspended for several months have been re-
sumed, with good prospects As will be seen by the table elsewhere the defi-
ciency in rainfall from January 1 to June 30 i still great, notwithstanding the large amount tha fell in June It is gratifying to note that the number of ob-
servers show a satisfactory increase by the resump-
tion of work at some of the stations which hav been idle for some time past, also by the additio of new slations, with good observers, who seem t take an interest in the work. The observers wh have all along been so faithful and prompt in thei reports are to be congratulated on the apparent in-
creasing interest shown in their work. Altogether,
we note with pride that the service in the State i in better condition than since its organization,
more than six years ago, and we hope, through th kind and prompt co-operation of our corps of vol-
untary observers, to keep it progressing still highe in the scale of excellence.

TO THE FKIENDS OF SANITARY
PROGRESS IN TENNESSEE Two years ago the State Board of Healt determined to publish a Monthly Bulletin a a -medium of communication between itself,
the general public, and the various Count and Local Boards of Health. Just at thi time the Bureau of Agriculture discontinue its connection with the State Weather Service,
an offshoot of its. own. A strong apneal wa made to the State Board of Health to tak charge of this important public work in con-
nection with its own climatological work This appeal was heeded. For the past tw years the Bulletin lias been devoted to the
.Meteorology of the State, as well as to offi-
cial sanitary notes Very large editions of special numbers wer issued, and systematically distributed in ever nook and corner of Tennessee, at heavy ex-
pense for printing and postage. It was hope that the General Assembly of 1887 would se the necessity of increasing the appropriatio for the Board so as to meet this heavy expend-
iture for printing and circulating informatio among the people; but although climatolog is becoming a pressing topic for State ai throughout the Union, this appropriation wa withheld The Board, however, is unwilling to discon-
tinue a journal which is gathering up and pre-
serving records of climate and disease perma-
nently valuable to investigators at home an abroad, and which consequently has met wit high favor from all such Hence, with the beginning of the third vol-
ume a small subscription is asked, which wil barely meet the expense of printing. Ou friends in Tennessee are requested to get u lists for us without delay Proceedings of the Quarterly Meeting o the Board, July 5, 1887 Eleven A. M.—The Board met according t law. Present: J. M.

dent; J. D. Plunket, I). F. Wright, P. P Sims, and the Secretary, Dr. Lindsley. Ab-

Nashville, Tenn., July 5, 18S7. i"
Dr. J. I). Plunket, President Slate Board Health:
Sir—For the three months ending June 30t the Monthly Bulletin has given members of this
Board, and also a large circle of readers in ever part of Tennessee, as full information concernin sickness and mortality as it is possible to get with-
out laws for obtaining vital statistics. A griev-
ous disappointment it is to all interested in prac-
tical sanitary work, that this great and advancing
State o£ Tennessee should be so notoriously lie-

hind in one of the main characteristics of a civil-
ized people. For two years more, however, w must stumble along as best we can in a twiligh furnished mainly by voluntary :uid public spirite observers In the meantime, while waiting for details,
without which accurate science is impossible,  great field of practical work is open to Tennesse sanitarians Our'two millions of people are in a measur unprotected against one of the most hideous pest to which the human race is liable. Should smail-
[>ox orce fairly get a hold in Tennessee its rav-
ages would be fearful. The prophylaxis is wel established by the experience of European nation luring more than a century. Jt is strange tha the public and the medical profession are so stu-
pidly indifferent to this constantly impending peril One great cause of long-continued illness, o slow recovery, and of unnecessary mortality, is th foul air breathed, to a greater or less extent, by al who dwell in our cities and towns. Surface filil pollutes the atmosphere in all Tennessee cities,
towns and villages to an extent not imagined b our physicians and citizens. The streets, alleys,
and back-yards, even in our most thoroughl awake communities, are far from being cleaned u as systematically and frequently as should be th case. Health officers everywhere find this th great stumbling-block in their way. Our peopl and their servants, the public officials, must b aroused from their fatal lethargy. Filthy soi means polluted water and foul air. Filthy soi signifies the long train of ills which result fro polluted water and foul air The climate and the soil of Tennessee are the tw inestimable treasures bestowed upon us by a benef-
icent Providence. A shame it is that in a mag-
nificent region, dotted over with universities, col-
leges and academies, two such blessings should b nullified by ignorance and laziness!
In Tennessee, as everywhere else, the great figh must be against filth. This fight has hardly com-
menced. We may hope for more rapid progres in the near future, as the pioneer efforts of this
Board and its auxiliaries are now bearing marke results The following additions have been made to th library during the last quarter:

ecutive Committee The communication from Dr. G. P. Conn,
Secretary of the Conference of State Boards of
Health, was referred to the Executive Com-

tion from this Board to the said Associatio to hold its next annual meeting at the Capita of Tennessee After examining the accounts for the quar-
ter, the Board adjourned to meet on October
4, 1887 The Upland Geological Formations of
Obion, Dyer, Lauderdale, Tipton and
Shelby counties; their Goneral Fea-
tures and Sanitary Relations.
BY J. M. SAFFORD, M. D. Chairman of the Committee on Water Supply.
[Continuedfrom last month.]
In presenting in more detail the relations o the Loess and Orange Sand to the counties in
Tennessee in which it is found, one cannot d better perhaps than to follow up the geolog of the line of the Chesapeake aud Ohio rail-
road, running as it does, length wise from nort to south, quite through the entire belt an wholly within the area of the two formations It will bo recollected, we note parenthetically,
that we have to do with the uplands, so tha bottom areas are excluded The railroad in leaving Kentucky first en-
ters Obion county, Obion may be taken a typical of the Loess belt of counties, in whic are included, we may repeat, besides Obion Dyer, Lauderdale, Tipton and Shelby. Obio is the freshest of them all, and perhaps bette represents the others in their condition before,
the cultivation of cotton had taxed their re-
sources so heavily. It was farther away fro the center of destructive cotton culture i slavery times; its soils, in general, have no been so overworked; old and thrown outfield are not as often met with; it had more fores to clear up for new land ; its people have bee enterprising, and now the county stands in th forefront, active and prosperous. It is a won-
derful area. No county in the State wit such giant timber—whole houses in a singl log, trees with dimensions so great that th report of tliem staggers belief In speaking thus of Obion, however, I d not intend to disparage the other counties In general features they are like Obion, an are in the same category. In some respect they have the advantage. Most of them, a an example, can boast a greater area of leve or favorably rolling uplands, for parts of
Obion are exceedingly rough and hilly Their worn soils have generally strong under-
soils, and can be restored, and many hav been. The restoration is nearly always practi-
cable where washes and gullies have not bee permitted to grow and grievously mar the sur-
face and thus ruin the land. These countie have, too, a fair quota of new- and fresh lan of great and generous fertility. At any rate,
take them as they are and considering thei uplands alone, they will not suffer in contras with any group of counties of the same num-
ber in the State. Their soils are based upo the Loess, and this holds all the fundamenta requisites of a strong fertility Nearly all the cuts excavated for the bed o the Chesapeake road, from the Kentucky lin to Memphis, are iu the Loess, and many o them give sections of special interest. Th first we mention, however, is on another road,
the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis. It i about the fourth of a utile west of Paducah
Junction, the point where the two roads cross It is a long cut through a low dividing ridge,
and shows at its deepest part the followin section of the formations:
1. Soils, resting directly on the Loess, ther being no appeareuee of the Yellow Clay
Loam.
2. Loess, well characterized, 6 feet thick At the bottom shows transition into th formation below.
3. Orange Sand or Drift, G feet exposed,
mostly coarse, compact sand, a littl clayey; yellowish gray with trace of re in upper part; orange below: grains o sand rounded; a few quartz pebbles o the size of peas in the lower part The summit passed here is the highes point on the road between the Junction aud

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Union City. The Orange Sand appears at th bottom and middle of the cut, and, with  broadly rounded upper surface, presents itsel as the longitudinal axis or core of the ridge,
with the layers of Loess and soils resting lik inverted shallow troughs upon it. The Loes here has but little thickness, pointing to th fact that the Junction is not far from th feather edge or eastern limit of the formation Going westerly its thickness notably increases,
as is seen at Union City, and especially about
Troy, the county-scatof Obion, in the neighbor-
hood of which it ranges from 100 to 200 feet The fact that wells, sunk into the Loess at
Union City and Troy, supply hard limeston water, has already been referred to and th reason for it given. A word here further a to Troy. The town has a pleasing location o high ground. The formation underlying it is
Loess, and the cuts about the place affor good opportunities for the study of the charac-
teristics of this earthy and remarkable deposit The gravel and Rand of the Drift or Orange
Sand formation, which lie next below the
Loess, were not seen in the lowest places o the branches, though their horizon must b nearly reached. On the road to Union City,
at a point within two miles of Troy, a small
.stream flowing between high hills has cut it way down through the Loess into the grave and sand, and, indeed, through these to th top of the Lignitic Group. At no other poin on the Union City road has this occurred, so fa as I have seen. The formation is Loess all th way. The high hills, just referred to are ver steep, and present the formation in great force One mile from Troy on the Dyersburg road,
immediately after crossing Mill Creek, on ascends a formidable hill known as Faulk's
Hill. On this there is a wonderful presenta-
tion of the Drift gravel. It is the be of the road from the creek to nearly the to of the hill. The presence of this grave appears to be due to a great uplift of th formations, resulting from a faulting an displacement of the strata, though the com-
paratively enormous volume of gravel ma point to a different explanation. How it ha occurred is a problem to be solved. But b this as it may, the quantity of the materia exposed is truly extraordinary.
VVe now pass back to the Chesapeake roa and persue our course toward Memphis From Faducah Junction through Rives and
Newbern on to Dyersburg, all the railroa cuts are in the Loess, some of them exposin instructive sections. No Orange Sand wa observed in any of them Rive* is in Obion county, and has impor-
tance for the reason that at this point the
Chesapeake'.road (the C, O. & S. W. railroad)
is crossed by the Mobile & Ohio road. It is  thriving business point, located just outsid and west of the part of the bottom of the
Obion river subject to overflow. It may b said to be in the second bottom of the river,  very fertile and level area, running back fro the town nearly a mile to a line of slopin hills. These hills begin the uplands o table-lands, which extend with more or les continuity far west to the vicinity of Reelfoo lake. They are made up of Loess, and are o easy access from Rives for observation an study Newbern.. This active business place is o the railroad in Dyer county, nearly nine mile northeast from Dyersburg, the county-seat It is located in an elevated and rolling belt o country between the Obion and North Forked
Deer rivers. For ten miles in every directio around Newbern, the country is rich an thickly populated. One is never out of sigh of a house. It is asserted that this area pro-
duces more than any equal area in the State,
the products being chiefly corn, cotton, to-
bacco and wheat. The uplands are based o the fine material of the Loess, and is a goo example of the lands this formation gives u when the surface has a favorable topograph and lies well. The railroad cuts and expos-
ures in the vicinity of the town all show th earthy material of the Loess. The gravel an sands of the Orange Sand formation are no seen. These in the town itself are reached i digging wells at a depth of 60 or 80 feet,

HEALTH Iff TENNESSEE Extraot of Reports of Health Officer? and Official Corres-
pondents to the State Board of Health
The reports of our correspondents, wh though for the most part health officials, ye are so poorly paid as to be virtually voluntee observers, for the month of July, while brief,
are still full of interest. The connection o climate with disease is plainly evident. Th general good health of Tennessee equally so The field for investigating the causes of dis-

BHPOBT FOB JITX."^, 1887 The Oiinitt «f Jury presented the astta amount of electrical disturbances, but tVe
^principal t'eatwre was tbe excessive ami an-
preceaeated heat during tie latter halt of th month The mean temperature was 78° 8, consider-
ably :iKn\<- the normal, and the highest mea for many years. The maximum temperature
-was 181 recorded on three different days; th minimum was 56° recorded on the 1st, and
-was the highest July minimum since 1883 The hot wave which came about the Kith,
■culminated generally about the 17th-19th,
-but continued with a slight relaxation until
•the close of the month, and was the longest
■warm spell ever known. The ranges of tem-
perature were about the normal The precipitation was rather below th average, the mean being 3.32 inches; of thi amount, the Eastern division received a average of about four inches, and the othe two divisions about three inches. The great
•est monthly rainfall was 5.67 inches, reporte at Grief!, iu lower East Tennessee, and th least rainfall was only 0.80 inch, reported at
Woodstock, in the extreme southwestern por-
tion of the State. The greatest local dail rainfall was 2.13 inches, reported at Florence
Station, on the 24th. The days of greates rainfall were the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 21st, 24th,
the last showing the greatest daily fall. Mos of the rains were very light and local i character. It is worthy of remark that wit such a small average precipitation, there wa only one day during the month—the 15th—on
•which rain was not reported at one or mor stations in the State, yet the table show many rainless intervals; the week of the
14th-20th, was the "dry week," and wit the exception of a few local rains in East
Tennessee, and two or three in the wester part of the State, there was a serious absenc of precipitation. It was during this perio that the hot wave culminated and was s severely felt. Many of the rains were at-
tended with severe electric storms, some o which were very destructive to life and prop-
erty. The proportion of cloudiness was abou the normal The percentage of verification of the tem-

A number o these springs have locally quite a high thera-
peutic value accorded them, in affording relie in rheumatism and gout, and in certain form of kidney, bladder, stomach, liver and intesti-
nal disorder What is wanted is fuller and more accurat information regarding the mineral springs o the State, especially their clinical value an chemical composition Board Eecently Organized Tullahoma City Board op Health—

Miller Scarlet Fever in Tullahoma.
SPECIAL REPORT Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, August 21, 1887-
Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Boar of Health—Sir: Carrying out the direction of the Executive Committee, given yesterday,
as follows, have visited Tullahoma:
"1. Investigating the rumored outbreak o scarlet fever at that point, noting details, wit number of cases and deaths to date."
It seems that the first case occurred som six weeks ago, a child aged 3 years, who wit its mother had just returned from Nashville,
having visited relatives there The next two cases occurred in a famil intimate with the above These three cases are the only ones amon the citizens proper. Of a very mild form, an ready recovery The other cases were in the group of con-
solidated hotels, to-wit: Two cases in th family of a gentleman from Nashville, whic occupied a cottage on the hotel ground. De-
veloped soon after arriving in Tullahoma; on now well and the other recovering. And on case, now well and gone home, in a famil which occupied a room in the main building,
and no doubt had intercourse with the famil above-mentioned. And five cases in a famil from Nashville, occupying a cottage on hote grounds. Of these one is now well, two ar convalescing, one still ill, (the only case a present) and one died j a little boy about nin years old, originally of a very delicate consti-
tution. There seems to be no doubt that th children of this family had communicated wit the other family from Nashville where the tw cases prevailed, although the cottages were o different squares The said two cases may have got the infec-
tion in Nashville, or may have caught it fro either of the town families, both at no grea distance from the hotels The physicians in attendance and othe parties agree in representing the disease as o a very mild form. Of the total eleven case one was fatal.

The authorities of Tullahoma had alread begun action as to a local board. The act t establish it needs but one more reading There can be no doubt that the above sug-
gestions will be fully carried out.

The hotels use lime freely, an employ scavengers to empty the vessels dail or oi'tener if needed The water supply is abundant, clear and cool,
from deep wells, of which there are many There is also a magnificent and copious sprin of freestone water The general sanitary condition of the tow is unquestionably good. The people, except i a small business area, are scattered about i neat and handsome houses, occupying muc room. For years they have recognized th importance of cleanliness Of course, while depending upon wells an springs for water, it is of prime necessity tha the surface through which drainage may ente these wells should be absolutely free fro night soil, garbage or filth of any descriptio whatever. As the town has now a population,
permanent and floating, of quite 4,000 souls,
this will be impossible without the rigid en-
forcement of stringent laws From the details given under the first hea some interesting conclusions are clear Itis evident that all parties were misled by th lightness of the cases into a neglect of warnin the public and strictly isolating the patients Had these two cardinal axioms of sanitar practice been carried out at the start, there i every reason for believing that the diseas would have been confined to the first cas enumerated above, as far as the citizens wer concerned, and to the one family at the hotel,
three cases in all, instead of eleven, with a death.
A live board of health, clothed with du authority, would have seen to this. Unneces-
sary alarm and panic would have been averte and much damage prevented With so little precaution against the sprea of the disease, and the town crowded wit children, it certainly speaks well for the salu-
brity of the climate that it was confined to s few houses, was of such mild character, and i now disappearing entirely under proper iso-
lation and disenfection. In the last ninetee years scarlet fever has occurred three times in
Tullahoma, in each instance imported All of which is respectfullv submitted bv

and also a few cases of fever—typhoid and ma-
larial. During the month of August the bowe affections were observed less frequently and th fever much more frequently. These latter pre-
vailed almost entirely in the country, the tow being entirely healthy. The character of th fevers that prevailed in August, or the latter par of the summer, seemed to me to be a littl anomalous for this country. Neither typhoid no malarial as described in the books generally, no a blending of the two, as described by som authors. The outset of the fever was gradual,
but when once fully developed, the temperatur was us high as it ever became during the progres of the disease It was continuous, although wit marked lowering of the temperature in the morn-
ings. There were few or none of the nervou symptoms generally seen in typhoid fever, neithe were there nausea and vomiting, as usual in ma-
larial fevers, nor were there diarrhea, gurglin nor distension, as seen in typhoid fever. On th contrary, constipation was the rule. I saw n rose-colored spots. Toward the close of the dis-
ease profuse perspirations were frequent; thes were sometimes exhausting. The disease gener-

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
E. A. Cobleigh, Secretary City Board of Health—
For August I report a lingering of summer com-
plaints among all classes, but particularly child-
ren Some cases of dysentery, but with a ver low fatality. A few cases of pneumonia are re-
ported; and a considerable prevalence, just at th close of the month, of pharyngitis, catarrhs an diseases of that ilk, due to a cool wave, followin the " dog-days." Our prevalent ailments, how-
ever, are continued fevers—some typhoid, an considerable malarial fever, but not so widesprea as during the two preceding months. The sum-
mer has been marked by a greater prevalence o febrile diseases than usual, but with a remarkabl insignificant degree of mortality, though of cours some deaths have occurred. The increase o fevers is variously attributed to a partially ne source of water supply, to a more than usuall rank growth of vegetation, a remarkably hot sum-
mer, bad drainage, vast amount of excavating fo new buildings and sewers, and other causes Whooping-cough iB also with us in the city, an one or two cases of alleged diphtheria have bee reported. With these exceptions the health o the city is excellent, and, as before stated, eve the prevalent diseases show a steady decrease o late Hancock county—Dr. Wm. P. Mahan, County

County Health Officer.—The month of Augus was exceptionally healthy; not as much sick-
ness of a malarial origin as the month before Colds and catarrhal fevers are prevailing almos epidemically, seeming to depend on some mor-
bific agent in the atmosphere. An excess of hea and dryness like an excess of moisture has checke the malarial type of fevers Hardin county—Dr. J. K. Barlow, County
Health Officer.—During August we had som few cases of whooping-cough and diphtheria an considerable malarial ailments; more sicknes than we have had for several months and wit greater fatality. Health generally is much bette at present; still some whooping-cough in differen parts of the county. Some cholera infantum, bu less than previous months Hawkins county—Dr. R. P. Mitchell, County
Health Officer.—Dysentery still lingers, but ha assumed a mild type, and yields readily to medi-
cal treatment. There has been several cases o diphtheria, confined to one locality, however; tw deaths in one family. We have had several case of rheumatism, and also of typhoid and remitten fevers. One case of hemiplegia. The health o our county improved during the latter part of

Health Officer.—During the past two months w have had an increase in sickness in this county For the month of July there was a great deal o bowel troubles. In the eastern part of the count it was in many cases fatal. In that part of th county it was in the form of flux. They los as well as I can learn, about 30 cases during th six weeks or two months that the epidemic lasted About the middle of August, the bowel trouble passed away, and there is now, in the east, mid-
dle and west part of the county, a very marke tendency to fevers, principally malarial, wit here and there a case of typhoid. I think th present increase of sickness, over what we gener-
ally have at this season of the year, is due to th continued dry weather. The branches, and es-
pecially the ponds (of which there are many i this counly), have nearly all dried up. Th waler used in many parts of the county is of  very bad qua lily; not only bod to the taste, bu muddy in appearance
Ear Boxing Science publishes some valuable record collected by Dr. Samuel Sexton on the ob-
served effects of boxing the ears. Dr. Sexto has fifty-one cases upon his records in whic the ear has been injured by blows of th open hatid or fist. The nature of the injurie varied considerably. One had inflammation o the ear, with suspicion of intracranial trouble,
and a running of the ear for twelve years fol-
lowing a blow ii])on that organ. This patien subsequently died of brain disease, in an-
other case the ear became inflamed and th hearing very much impaired. In anothe case the patient was slapped by his fathe upon the left ear and immediate pain an deafness ensued, with a bloody discharge,
from which he was three months in recover-
ing The dangers to which Dr. Sexton calls at-
tention are so grave that parents and all other should choose some other method of punish-
ing their children than boxing the ears. It i not improbable that, if Dr. Sexton pursue his inquiries further, he will find other case in which brain disease has followed this bar-
barous practice.—Ex The Upland Geological Formations of

( hnirman of the Committer on Water Supply.
[Continuedfrom lust month.]
From NewLern to Dyersburg the railroa excavations are made as heretofore in th prevailing formations of the country, the
Loess. Approaching Dyersburg, several in-
structive cuts are passed through Dji< rsburg, t he county-seat of Dyer( is lo-
cated on the north bank of the North forked
Deer river. It is an enterprising, attractiv town, built on high ground; has a commendabl quota of churches, schools, mills and mercan-
tile establishments, and is the center of  fertile and well-settled section of the county.
A substantial and handsome iron bridge span the river, connecting with a trestle and "levee"
which cross the wide bottom opposite th town. In favorable stages of the river steam-
boats ply between the place and the Mississ-
ippi, tints supplying water navigation Dyersburg is one of the points at which the
Forked Deer, in its meanders through it great bottoms, strikes the uplands. The bluf thus formed is the foot of a slope which de-
scends gradually from the highlands back o the town, and upon which the town itself i built. The superior formation is everywhere
Loess. Underlying this at the lowest levels,
as for example, at the base of the bluff, and i a deep ravine made by a branch runnin through the eastern portion of the town, out-
crops of the sands of the Drift or Orange
Sand arc seen. The formation rises as we go

  p. 19 (#25)                        STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Il back from the river. At the base of the bluf the outcrop shows a thickness of six feet frou the low water line up. Ascending the ravine,
a half or three-fourths of a utile from th river, a bold and characteristic outcrop of the
Drift is exjiosed. Tt is here twenty feet thick,
and the sands are largely dug into and use for building purposes. It is known as th sand-bank. The section is as follows:
1. Loess, at top, from 40 to 50 feet thick Orange Sand, Drift.
(a.) Sand, orange colored, with some clay,
often in a compact, hard layer, six feet.
(I.) Loose Orange Sand with white sand i irregular vein-like masses and pockets,
resting on deep yellow sand, eight feet,
(c. ) Part not exposed, dowu to branch, fiv feet No gravel is seen in this bank, but abou one hundred yards below, on the same branc and just above it, is a conspicuous bod o gravel mixed with sand, which is eight fee thick. The junction of the two formations,
the Loess and the Drift, can be satisfactoril studied in this ravine The position of the underlying Orange San at Dyersburg ought to establish a good under-
surface drainage for the town. Water an sewage sinking through the more or less per-
vious Loess, are received by the sands an carried off at their outcrops; and, on th other baud, for this very reason, the spring which issue from this horizon of sands ough to be guarded against. They may become con-
taminated and rendered unfit for drinking pur-
poses, especially if the water they discharg comes from under a thickly populated portio of the town. Many of the citizens use cister water, mostly, however, I believe, becaus wells in the Loess supply hard water From Dyersburg to Kipley, the county-sea of Lauderdale, the bed of the railroad, out-
side of the bottoms, lies all the way—with th exception of a single break—on the earthy
Loess. So it appears, at least, to one travel-
ing the road. Out after cut displays th yellowish gray and ashen material of thi formation. The exception occurs at a saw-
mill station six miles north of Ripley, named
"Curve"—so named because the road, imme-
diately south of the station, makes a note curve in passing through a prominent ridge This ridge is the "divide" between the water of South Forked Deer River and Cane Creek The curve lies in a deep cut, in which th formations are well exhibited. Conspicuou in the lower part is the Orange Sand, show-
ing here much gravel mixed with sands Pebbles of unusual size, some as large a goose eggs and larger, are seen. Resting o this is the horizontal bed of Loess, rising u in threatning walls above one's head. Th formations are first observed back at th station, before entering the cut Ripley, the county-seat of Lauderdale,  prosporous town, noted for its higher educa-
tional advantages and the intelligence of it l>eople, is "a city set upon a hill." Buil upon an elevated ridge, or high belt of table-
land, the water-shed between Cane Creek o the north and Hatchie River on the south, i can, of all the towns in Tennessee along the
Chesapeake, Ohio A Southwestern Road, boas the greatest altitude and doubtless the pures air. On the east side of the town the belt o table land on which it is, contracts to a nar-
row neck or ridge. Through this the railroa passes in a fearful excavation or cut fifty fee deep, and with nearly perpendicular walls From the level of the higher and mor removed portions of the town it is sixty an seventy feet to the bed of the road. A bridg high in air spans the chasm, allowing ingres and egress for the population, without fear o accidents from moving trains.*
The two formations—the Loess and the
Orange Sand—are grandly exposed in th great walls of the cut. The locality is oue o special interest, and traveling geologists wil find it a good point for the study of thes quaternary formations. The section in th deepest part of the cut, under and just nort of the bridge, is as follows:
1. .SoiV* and Uocm, in the slopes from the highe level to the bridge 10 feet.
2. Lttfs*, well characterised from bridge down . 20 feet.
3. Aoeaa, a shade darker than above; its lowe part containing gravel and, sparsely,
glassy grains of sand, passing into th division below 8 feet.
4. Oratiite tiand or Drift, chiefly loose snnds o orange and yellow colors, rarely white:
with occasionally in places white pip«
clay, mainly in p;iperymoro or less hoi i-
gontal seams, down t<> the road bed 20 feet The strata of the belt of highlands upo which Ripley is situated have been elevate in a great upward flexure or wave, wit its length lying approximately in an eas and west direction^ or transversely to th line of the railroad. In their presen condition the strata may be compared to  series of shallow and inverted troughs lyin in order one above another. To this remark-
able upward flexure the exceptional elevatio of the highland may be due. The railroa crosses this flexure, exposing in the deep cu the structure of the ridge. The road, afte leaving the valley of Cane Creek, in approach-
ing Ripley one mile to the south, ascend with a heavy grade, passes the summit in th cut, and then descends as rapidly, a mile an a fourth, to Batie's Creek. The strata of th formations have also their highest elevatio in the cut, and descend (or dip) each way,
north and south, even more rapidly than th railroad. So rapidly, indeed, that within les than half a mile from the summit on each side,
the Orange Sand has sunk out of sight, and the
Loess, notwithstanding the lower elevation,
is the only formation seen along the track.
[To be concluded.]
•This bridge, as T was informed, is one hundred an thirty feet above Batie's Creek a tributary of Hatchie
River, and crossed by the railroad a mile and a fourt to the south.

The features for August were the earth-
quake of the night of the 1st, and the abnor-
mally high temperature during the first au second decades. Otherwise there was bu little departure from the normal Tlie mean temperature was 76°.7, the high-
est August mean during tin? five years. Th highest temperature was 103°, recorded on the
3d, at Austin. Wilson county: and the nex highest was 102"', recorded on the 3d, 12t and 14th, at Milan, Gibson county. Th maximum, 101°, was recorded at Hiddleton Smith county, on the 15th, at Savannah, Har-
din county, on the 2d, and at Bohenwald,
Lewis county, on the 2d, 3d and 5th. Th lowest temperature was 48°, recorded on the
25th, 29th and 31st, The monthly range o temperature was slightly in excess of the nor-
mal, as was also the mean daily range. Durin the last decade a period of low temperatur prevailed The mean precipitation was 3.07 inches,
which was about an inch less than the Augus mean of last year, and about that amount mor than the August means of the two precedin years. Of this amount, the Eastern divisio received an average of three and three-fourth inches, and the Middle and Western division about two and three-fourths inches. Th rains were mostly light and local in character Those of the 5th, 15th, 17th and 26th, however,
were general, the last named being the heavi-
est fall during the month. The greates monthly rainfall was 6.43 inches, at Rogers-

ville, and the least was only 1.21 inch, at
Memphis—the smallest August rainfall at tha station, since 1872, when only 0.54 of an inc was reported. The greatest local daily rain-
fall occurred at Milan, on the 19th, when 2.96
inches fell. This was strictly a local rain, it no other observer in the Stat* reported rai on that day except at Knoxville, and tha inappreciable. The observer at Milan reports
5.10 inches of rain at his station during thre days—the 19th. 20th and 21st. Several of th rain< (that of the 26th excepted) were attende by the usual electrical disturbances. Ther were eight days on which no measurable rai fell The feature of the month was the earth-
quake on the night of the 1st, noted elsewhere,
which was felt more or less over the Stat* Dews were reported on about fifteen days The percentage of verification of weathe and temperature predictions, furnished dail from the Signal Office at Washington, to th various stations in the State during the month,
was for the State: weather, 91.4 per cent., an temperature 95.5 per cent Thunder storms were reported as follows:

road. At 5:40 p. M., there was a high wind
(force 6) from N. E. with dashes of rain—th magnet showing no evidence of disturbanc by atmospheric electricity The observer at Grief says: The mont was noted particularly for the amount of heav thunder accompanying rains, until the 17th Lightning was very vivid—mostly forked Until the rain of the 26th, there was very lit-
tle precipitation; since that the temperatur has been somewhat below the average, and th nights have been especially cool The observer at Riddleton says: The lon continued dry weather has been very injuriou to crops and pastures. Late corn is a failure Turnips have been sown three or four time without success in some instances The observer at Austin says: The groun has been drier than I have seen it for mor than twenty years, in this section. In som parts of this (Wilson) county, and also i parts of Smith county, there has been bu little suffering for rain At Nashville on the 16th, just at sunset,
the entire west was lighted up with a beautifu and brilliant flame color, giving the appear-
ance of an immense fire raging; the color ex-
tended upward at least 50°. This was followe immediately by a heavy rain and thunder storm The observer at Farmingdale reports tha during the storm of the 15th. the tempera-
ture fell from 94° to 76° in thirty minutes The same observer reports that during th storm of the 22d, lightning struck  large oak tree standing close to Maple Sprin school-house. The shock broke several pane of glass in the windows, and badly frightene the pupils.

EARTHQUAKE The feature of the month was the seismi disturbance on the night of the 1st, shortl after midnight. It was distinctly felt at
('larksville,Columbia, Murfreesboro, Gallatin,
Tullahoma, Chattanooga, Jackson, Union City,
MeMinnville, Waverly, Franklin, Nashvill and many other places in the State. It wa also felt at St. Louis, Kvansville and generall throughout southern and central Illinois,
southern Indiana and western Kentucky There was little or no damage done, but man were badly frightened by the shocks (whic lasted but a few seconds), remembering th shake of eleven months ago The observer at Nashville reports the phe-
nomenon as follows: On the 2d, l:3l>'.30"
A M., seismic disturbances were experienced;
from 1:36'.30" to IM'M" a.m., there wer fully fourteen or fifteen distinct vibrations,
shaking the office building (the Signal Servic office is in the fourth story of the Burns Block,
a large and lofty building) so perceptibly a to cause the windows and doors to rattle. Th vibrations were apparently from the sout toward the north. A low rumbling noise wa heard which sounded like cannonading at  distance. Window casings and other woo work about the building creaked, and plaster-
ing in the office fell to the floor; inkstands,
paper-weights and other articles were dis-
placed. Many persons in the city ran fro their houses in terror. The shock was mos severely felt in East Nashville.

SVB3C1UPTION, - - - 2Sc l'KR ANNUM Entered at the Postoffice at Nashville .as Second Clays
Matter On the night of September 22, the steamship
Alesia arrived below New York with six hun-
dred passengers from Marseilles and Naples Eight of her passengers died of cholera o the passage, and on her arrival at quarantin the health officers reported four cases o hoard; four others were discovered when in-
specting the passengers. The well passenger were removed the same day to Hoffman islan for observation, and the sick to Swinburne
Island Hospital. The number of cases o board on arrival was eight; twenty cases hav developed among the passengers since the have been under observation to this date; fiv of those removed from the vessel have die and three recovered. Of those that have de-
veloped while in quarantine, nine have died,
four have recovered, five arc convalescent, an the remaining two are now seriously ill. Th disease has been very virulent and nrpid in it fatality in a majority of the cases; in severa instances patients that were well at inspectio in the afternoon were nearly or quite pulseles within twelve hours. There had been no de-
velopment of cases among the immigrants u to October 5th The efficiency of the New York City and
State regulations and officials in preventin the spread of a dangerous epidemic diseas will now be fully tested. All precautions a to isolation and disinfecting seem to he thor-
oughly carried out The existence of cholera in Western Europ is a standing menace to America. For some-
thing over three years it has prevailed in vari-
ous portions of South France, Italy and Spain,
in a virulent form. Thence it found acces to Brazil and Chili last winter, doing grea damage. This is not the time to go asleep The American Public Health Association
Holds its next annual session at Memphis November 8-11. Leading sanitarians from al parts of America will take part in its proceed-
ings. A very large attendance is expecte from Tennessee and the adjoining States espe-
cially. The local committee announce reduce railroad and hotel rates. Dr. (i. 15. Thornton,

  p. 26 (#32)                        STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN President State Board of Health—Sir: Nea the close of the last quarter I sent the followin communication to the Mayors of the eighty tw principal cities and towns in Tennessee:
Dear Sir: In view of the great uneasines felt throughout the United States by the ap-
proaches of cholera, and the alarm just oc-
casioned by the few hut virulent cases of yel-
low fever at Key West, it is of the highes importance that all our cities and towns be a once placed in the best sanitary condition; o in other words be thoroughly cleaned up. I
am collecting statistics as to the actual san-
itary work now done in the State and woul like to know whether you have means fo thorough and constant removal of night soi and garbage. If so, how many men and cart are employed in this work ; and what are you laws and regulations on the subject? An earl answer will be much appreciated The following replies have been received—
Morristown, Hon. J. B. Halloway, Mayor:
The sanitary condition of our town is not wha it should be. We have no regular means o removing garbage, etc Tazewell—T. W. Stone, Attorney at law:
Can say that our little town of 400 populatio is not incorporated, therefore we have no
.Mayor. We have no laws and regulations i regard to cleaning the town except the statut laws of our State Kingston—George W. Henderson, Mayor:
Our town, has a sanitary committee, compose of three Aldermen, whose business it is to loo after the removal of night soil and garbage They have done their work well and the tow is in good sanitary condition. The town i situated upon high rolling ground, and i easily drained. Our town is not large enoug to require the constant use of men and carts Only as necessity requires are they used. Ou regulations empower the Sanitary Committe to employ as many men and carts as are re-
quired to keep the town in thorough sanitar condition McMinnville—Hon. Jesse Walling, Mayor:
Will say we are now placing our city in a first-
class sanitary condition, using lime freely an cleaning up well Shelbyville—Hon. John W. Ruth, Mayor:
We have one mule and cart with a driver i constant service and under the direction o our Sanitary Committee. We have verystrin-
gent ordinances requiring all privies, cellar and backyards to be kept clean, which ar regularly inspected by police officers detaile for that duty. All places and backyards ac-
cessible to the public are regularly cleaned u twice a week by the scavenger force of the city Our people have lime furnished them free fo disinfecting purposes. With the recollectio of former visits of cholera to our place, we ar aware of the great need of being in good san-
itary condition. Our scavenger force consist of one mule and cart, two men, including on policeman when on that duty Murfreesboro—Hon. H. E. Palmer, Mayor:
Replying to your letter requesting me to fur-
nish the State Board of Health with th means we (this city) have for " thorough au con tan t removal of garbage and night soil,"' I
beg to say that our town is reasonably wel cleared of garbage twice per week. The la of our corporation requires that private prem-
ises be kept in a clean and healthy condition,
and if it is found that any citizen is negligen in this respect, his premises are ordere cleansed and the occupant subjected to fine Our citizens have been furnished with lim from the public treasury, and our laws exact-
ing its application to sanitary purposes ar sufficiently stringent. The creek which run through the city has been rip-rapped and wel cleaned. We keep constantly employed on eart and three men, for the general purpose of the city Nashville—T. A. Kercheval, Mayor: I reply to your esteemed favor, I would infor you that in the line of removing night soi there are two parties running constantly eac an odorless excavating machine, which i doing good and constant work. In addition t these, there area number of wagons running
•which use the regulation barrels, and they ar doing constant work. I may say, therefore,
that this branch of the sanitary work is bein pretty well served, though I think if the forc was larger there could be plenty of work foun for all of them to do. There is more of thi kiud of work done this year than ever befor in one year, owing to increase in jwpulatio and new residences that have gone up; and i the city continues to grow, of course this wor will increase in proportion. There is a poo portion yet of the privies that have not beo cleaned out. The sanitary officers are takin each his district in systematic order, givi notice to the householder, and the night s<J
scavengers are following on behind doing tj work. The law on this subject is to arre and fine a citizen if he does not have his pri cleaned out within five days after notice giv by the sanitary officer. The garbage force,  aside to haul off garbage, ashes, etc., and J
clean gutters and alleys, is used exclusively I
that purpose and consists of one large ti horse slop wagon, one slop cart, one a.sh wa twelve garbage carts with thirty-three hh
In case of a push, the regular street forc diverted to scavenger duty; the work-ho prisoners, who will average fifteen men I
month, are also worked in the sanitary dep ment. This force is doing fair work, and  much complaint is coming in, though, bu the many and thorough washing rains we h had, doubtless this force could not have swered our purposes. So I should think w the Lord puts in licks for us occasionally!
his copious showers, we maybe able to I
the city in reasonable sanitary condil
Hoping that this will cover the scope of  inquiries, and will reach you in time to A
your purposes, I again thank you for the h you have done me in calling for a report.

Franklin—W. D. Neely, Mayor: We hav a regularly organized Hoard of Health. Dr.
S. J. House is Chairman and Health Officer We instructed him in early spring to mak inspection of the town. This was completed
May 1, and he reported the town at that tim in a very good sanitary condition. Since tha time he has endeavored to keep it in good con-
dition (and has devoted his special attentio to the foulest localities), hut reports it almos impossible to do so. The worst nuisances w have are privy-vaults and pig pens, and wit these exceptions the town is in good condition We have only surface drainage here. Kee constantly employed one man, one mule an cart. The man generally keeps the streets an alleys clean. We have no men employed fo special removal of night soil and garbage When we find a nuisance our law authorize proper officers to proceed at once against own-
ers of the property, and if not abated at  certain time, to enforce the penalty and powe of the law. By this means we usually succeed Columbia—Hon. Jos. Towler, Mayor: I
would state that we have a good code of sani-
tary laws, and they are very well enforced b our Health Officer. Dr. Robt. Pillow We have two carts, with sufficient numbe of hands] as may be necessary, for the remova of garbage. These laws we find very difficul to enforce satisfactorily, but our Health Office in not afraid to do his duty. ■
Huntingdon — Hon. Ceorge T. McCall,
Mayor: In answer to yours I have to say:
We have no organized sanitary system excep a town Board of Health, whose suggestions w try to observe Bolivar —Hon. C. M. Wellons, Mayor:
Would say we have no regular force for th work mentioned. But the City "Marshal i is ordered to notify all persons and to see tha all infective places are thoroughly cleansed This he has attended to and our city is now i good condition. Thanking you for your ad-
vice, and we will try to keep it up Union City—Hon. S. Waddell, Mayor:
Will say that while we have no regularl organized sanitary force we have a committe who looks closely to the sanitary interest o our town and up to date reports sanitary con-
dition good. Of course this committee ha command of all the assistance needed, and w have an officer to inspect vaults, etc., weekly In fact, we are doing all we can to preserv the health of our city and guard against disease Memphis—Hon. D. P. Hadden, President
Taxing District: We now have our eye turned toward all sanitary matters and thin our city is now in a condition to ward off al diseases The above correspondence gives a correc view of the present state of local sanitation in
Tennessee. Only three or four municipalitie in the entire State are awake to the importanc of this, the crowning feature of modern civili-
zation, to-wit. healthy homes for all the people Reviewing the work of this Board for thre years, beginning with July 1, 1884, one is dis-
appointed that so little apparent progress ha been made. During these three years a ver large proportion of the meagre funds of this
Board has been expended in printing and cir-
culating sanitary documents and tracts sys-
tematically throughout Tennessee. No count has been overlooked. Special care has bee taken to' get at all county, city and Stat officials. Physicians, clergymen, lawyers, lead-
ing manufacturers and farmers have all bee reached. In this work the press of Tennesse has also assisted with characteristic liberality While very much has been done in effectin a thorough organization of County Boards of
Health, and in creating popular interest i sanitary progress, it is evident that the tim has come for carrying out the plan propose by Dr. Thornton, at the quarterly meeting o this Board, July 7,1885, namely, directing the
Secretary to lecture on " Local Sanitation" i the principal towns of the State, and also t instruct local Health Officers as to the bes methods of dealing with cases of contagiou diseases, and reporting same to this Board On the 7th and 8th of September I attende closely all the sessions of the National Confer-
ence of State boards of health at Washington The main business transacted was a sligh modification of the compact adopted at To-
ronto, respecting inter-State notification of
'nfectious diseases, so as to render it mor easy of observance The Monthly Bulletin may now be re-
garded as permanently a feature of the Board' work. It should be enlarged by four addi-
tional pages, so as to give space for fulle information respecting sanitary matters in
Tennessee, thus much increasing its interes at home and abroad As a means of making Tennessee favorabl known abroad, this periodical is certainl doing all concerned much credit, and it ough to be distributed far more extensively tha our means now allow The constantly increasing clerical work i this office makes it necessary and economica to purchase a type-writer and cyclo-style fo the use of the single clerk furnished as m assistant.

mittent. In Trenton there were three cases o diphtheria during September. The first case,

SUBSCRIPTION. - - - 25oPEB ANNCM Entered at the Postofliee at Nashville as Second Class
Matter Our Peril What the political views of the officers o the New York Quarantine Station are now o may be, is of but little interest to any beyon themselves; but what their method and prac-
tice is in preventing the introduction into thi country of the germs of exotic pestilentia disease, has a deep personal interest for eac of the seventy-five millions of human being who inhabit this continent. The simple an-
nouncement that vessels with Asiatic choler on board had recently arrived at New York,
sent a thrill over the whole country, and whe later the Associated Press dispatches expose the lax methods observed by these quarantin officials, in dealing with those infected vessel and crews, a wide-spread feeling, bordering o panic, was aroused. The facts given show tha while these officials are struggling for place,
their responsibilities and duties, as such, see to be either ignored or forgotten, as passenger with unopened packages of bedding, baggage,
et cetera, el cetera, direct from districts alon the Mediterranean, where cholera is raging a a malignant epidemic, are permitted to pas this quarantine station unmolested to point in the interior, there probably to scatter th seeds of the dread disease. The vigilan health officers of Chicago, Cleveland, Balti-
more, and Philadelphia, all report having lo-
cated and isolated for observation a numbe of these passengers, and also to have thor-
oughly disinfected their effects, or entirel destroyed the same by burning. For this,
outside of their several communities, the pu lie owe them a debt of gratitude. Again, th statement is given of one whose character i vouched for, that a few nights since he rowe to Hoffman'8 Island, where the cholera sus-
pects are supposed to be, and should be, undo-
ne closest surveillance, that nobody interfere with him, that he trafficked with them, an on leaving, carried eight letters ashore to mail While there, he was told that a number of thj'
detained passengers from off these infecte vessels had escaped from quarantine, and that-
from all he could see, there was nothing t prevent his boat load from doing likewise, a he returned to shore, if they chose. Whil possibly some of the details as given abov may be overdrawn, yet the fact stands out t be seen of all men that the quarantine of New
York, under its present management, afford no protection whatever to the American pub-
lic against the importation of this Asiati pest, and with the additional fact before u that eighty per cent, of the 334,203 immigrant who arrived in this country in 1886, cam through the port of New York, the extent o our peril would seem indeed to be alarming Health officers in Tennessee, and every-
where else throughout the country, for that,
matter, would do well to recognize the solem farce being enacted at the quarantine statio of New York—the inexcusable condition o affairs reported at this our most dangerou and least protected point, aud if Governor
Hill can not be induced to promptly remov this blot from off his otherwise strong adminis-
tration, which seems to fall but little short o a reckless tampering with the public health,
they should set about at once to make ever possible preparation to meet what, at thi writing, seems inevitable.

  p. 38 (#44)                        :S STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Chemistry of Food and its Adulterations.
BY DANIEL P. WRIGHT, 11. D.
ANIMAL FOOD,
[Since these papers have been commence there has appeared in the Century Magazin a series of article* under the heading "The
Chemistry of Food and Nutrition." Recog-
nizing the great scientific merit of these essays,
we had at one time thought of abandoning th subject to another bettor qualified to treat it,
but on reconsideration we find that the pur-
pose of that writer is not precisely the same a ours, and have concluded that there is roo for both of us. We shall therefore confin ourselves to a practically hygienic treatmen of the subject; at the same time we cordiall commend 10 our readers the study of Prof Atwater's description of the scientific method by which a minute quantitative analysis of th process of nutrition has been made possible.]
Tlie substances we described in our las paper, the carbo-hydrates and oils, take n part in the solid structure of the body except,
perhaps, in the elaboration of fat, but ar mainly consumed in the process of respiration,
whereby heat and other vital forces are kept up We now come to the consideration of a entirely different class of materials, those typi-
cally represented by the flesh, or (to be mor precise), by the muscular tissue of animals Substances of this class have already re-
ceived some of our attention under the name of albumen and casein in eggs, ratuin in milk,
and gluten in wheat and other grains used fo bread. The muscles of animals consist mainl of another substance of the class entitled myo-
,<(«(!. All these may be considered as chem-
ically identical, except for the presence i varying proportions of minute quantities o sulphur and phosphorus, and have been treate by physiologists as modifications of a hypot het-
ical compound which they have named protei or protoplasm It consists of four elements in the followin proportion: A hundred parts of protein, con-
tain
(Part: in 100.)
Carbon 53.8
Hydrogen 7.
X i I rogen 15.7
Oxygen 23.5
In albumen, the most common of protein com-
pounds, part of the oxygen is replaced by sul-
phur, in the following proportion:
Oxvgen 22.3
Sulphur 1.2
The radical difference between these sub-
stances and those described in our forme papers is that, whereas the carbo-hydrates, fats,
etc., consist exclusively of carbon, hydroge and oxygen, these are distinguished by th presence of a fourth element, nitrogen. Thei destination in the body marks a still more im-
portant distinction, thus:
All the others have to be decomposed an resolved into their original constituents o carbonic anhydride and water, before they ca subserve their purpose in tin; evolution o heat; but these protein compounds are appro-
priated as new substance incorporated in th animal tissues without chemical change. I other words, the muscular flesh of animals i. consumed as food and becomes a portion o human muscular tissue, chemically unchanged It was niyosiue when eaten, and continues t be niyosiue when it becomes human muscle So that, whether a hog eats man's flesh or ma eats hog's flesh, the process is the same, huma muscle becomes porcine muscle, or porcin human, according to which eats and which i eaten. Hence, emphatically the protein co pounds are designated nutritive or flesh-pro-
ducing foods, and the carbo-hydrates,oils, etc..
respiratory or heat-producing foods; a dis-
tinction, however, w hich must not be draw too closely, since the protein compounds ulti-
mately produce heat by their decompositio when done with, and the carbo-hydrates ar unquestionably metamorphosed in the anima system so as to produce fat There is another class of compounds, als containing nitrogen, but not capable of bein appropriated to the repair and growth of ani-
mal tissues. These are the materials of car-
tilage, fibrous tissues, membranes, and of ex-
tractive matters derived by pressure, boiling,
etc., from flesh. They have of late bee treated by physiologists as of no dietetic value,
perhaps without sufficient consideration,  question which will presently be considered They enter into our food catalogue in th form of soups, jellies and gravies Having thus briefly considered the chemica constitution of food materials, we have now t investigate those methods of administratio which determine their nutritive and sanitar value An eminent English agriculturalist, the late
Karl of Leicester, used to say that, in order t have good beef it must be well bred, well fed.
killed aright, kept aright, cooked aright an eaten aright, any of which provisions bein neglected the beef is ruined. These aphor-
isms of the good old earl may be taken xs the
Srogram of a treat ise on healthy food. Claud lemard has well said that the differen species of animals require different food, no so much as regards its chemical ingredients,
as in respect to the form in which they ar presented. For instance, a chicken will liv and grow fat on a few handfuls of barley, i the presence of which a dog would starve t death; but this is not because the barley i destitute of the material essential to the dog' nutrition, but because the dog's digestiv organs are incapable of reducing it to a con-
dition adapted to its assinilation. Grind th barley into meal and make a cake of it, an the dog can eat it and grow fat on it. Th difference is, that the chicken has a mill in its

  p. 39 (#45)                        STATE B OA RD OF HE A L Til B ULLETIN.
39
gizzard with which it can grind the grain,
while the dog has to rely on man for th grinding Thus all this matter of the preparation o food, the breeding, feeding, killing, cookin and eating, is simply a mode of adapting it t the peculiar structure of the digestive orga in man; to estimate, therafore, the merits o the processes enumerated, we must examin the human digestive organs and the digestiv process which goes on in them To put the matter in as simple a form a possible, let it be understood that all animals,
from man down to the minute organisms in-
visible to the naked eye, require the sam chemical ingredients in their food, namely,
protoplasm in some form, carbo-hydrates o oil or both, and certain salts of lime, iron, so-
da, etc., formed by the combination of these—
substances with carbonic, phosphoric and sul-
phuric acid. The microscopic organisms w have alluded to, without any special digestiv organs, absorb them directly from the water i which they float; others, a little higher in na-
ture's scale, attach themselves to the surfac of still higher creatures and obtain them para-
sitieally from the juices prepared by the digest-
ive organs of their patrons. So far no specia digestive system is required, as the nutritiv materials are presented in the form require by those simple organizations, without prepar-
ation. But above these are animals of a su-
perior organization which live by devourin bodily the substance of vegetables and animal previously organized. As soon as we arrive a this stage of existence we also arrive at th necessity for a special digestive system, adapte to the special form of the food consumed Thus, the digestive system of the carnivor is very simple and comprised in a small space,
while that of the herbivora is complex an voluminous for reasons which can be easil stated. The animal food of the carnivora pre-
sents the protoplasmic elements in very nearl the same proportions and mode of combinatio as they exist in the bodies to be nourished On the other hand, the vegetable food of th herbivora contains indeed protoplasmic ele-
ments, but these are mixed with starch an cellulose, which are carbo-hydrates, in suc overwhelming preponderance that it takes a immense quautity of such food to supply enoug protoplasm tor the needs of the system. Thu the digestive organs of these animals have t contain a much larger quantity of food at  time than those of the carnivora, and a muc more elaborate apparatus for separating th nutritious from the innutritions elements o the food, and for reducing to a form capable o assimilation those which are destined to usefu purposes in the animal system. The most un-
lnstructed enquirer who has ever seen the in-
testines of a carnivorous and a herbivorou animal, a dog and a sheep, for instance, canno fail to notice the simplicity of the former a compared with the magnitude and complicit of the latter Now, man is neither exclusively carnivo-
rous nor herbivorous but omnivorous. Hi digestive apparatus is something intermediat between the two, but approaches nearer to th carnivorous type. 80 long as he remains  savage and lives by the chase, he does wel enough as a carnivorous animal; but as soo as he cultivates the land ho assumes the mixe type, and combines the vegetable and the ani-
mal diet. This combination implies the art o cookery, for almost all vegetable food require preparation before human digestive organs ca assimilate it, and in the duly prepared mixe food he finds a means of subsistence both mor economical and better adapted to the develop-
ment of those faculties in regard to which h stands apart from and above all other livin creatures Our next paper, therefore, will be concerne with man as an animal capable of appropriatin to his own nutrition all those classes of food,
one or other of which are, respectively, th support of one or other of the aiverse being which stand beneath him in the scale of crea-
tion, a capacity which depends upon the em-
ployment of his reason in the selection, combi-
nation and preparation of the various food ele-
ments.

(JibiiOH county—Dr. T.J Happvl, County Health

E. A. Cobleigh, Secretary City Board of Health.—
For the month of October I have to report a gen-
eral improvement in the gross amount of sicknes prevalent in Chattanooga. Dysentery has oc-
curred with considerable frequency. Whooping-
cough lingers among us in a mild form, and not s wide spread. Diphtheria was reported during
October as becoming rather prevalent, and I made
Fpecial inquiries regarding it among physicians,
but could learn of only one or two cases havin semblance to this dread scourge; and no case were reported to my office, though the law require such report from practicing physicians in the cas of all contagious diseases falling under their care.
I therefore regard the reports of its prevalence a unfounded. Coughs, colds and catarrhal disease increase as winter draws near; pneumonia become more frequent, and there have been fatal case during the mouth. Fevers are not so widesprea as during midsummer, though the ratio of fata cases has been greater since close rooms becam necessary for comfort, and the season advanced The death from typhoid of several prominen people in rapid succession, and the serious illnes of others, attracted public attention to this feve among us, and created a false impression that i was on the increase, when in reality the contrar was the case Much divergence of opinion ha been manifest among physicians as to the exist-
ence of typhoid fever here, notwithstanding it prevalence in neighboring cilies, and more gen-
erally than usual in most all the towns of lower
East Tennessee. As to your correspondent he ha no hesitancy in his opinion as to the typhoi character of some of the fevers falling under hi observation. It is the general belief too, that th year has been one of greater fever prevalence tha common all over the country, and that this cit has been no exception to that rule. The predomi-
nating type of disease, however, has been malarial,
and these attacks are frequent now, though gradu-
ally lessening. Except as aforementioned, w have no epidemic* and comparatively little sickness Hancock county—Dr. Win. P. Mahan, County
Health Officer.—No report received Hmilemun county—Dr Jas. J. Neely, Jr., County
Health Officer.—The health of (his county for th month of October was never better There are n epidemics or contagious diseases prevailing with-
in its borders, and very little sickness from acci-
dental causes. The principal prevailing affection are catarrhal, from colds which require but littl remedial interference to rectify them. The town in the county are all in pretty good sanitary con-
dition and, in anticipation of the approach o cholera, more work will be done. I have hear of one case of diphtheria—ending in recovery Hardin county—Dr. J. K. Barlow, County
Health Officer.—No report received Hawkins county—Dr. R. P. Mitchell, County

:r.:e~po:r.t fob October,, issv October was characterized by the large per-
centage of" clear or fair weather and the almos total absence of electrical disturbances. Th other features showed but slight departure from the normal. The cold wave which passe over the State on the 5th, resulted in a ligh frost in the Eastern and Middle divisions Altogether, the month was a delightful one The mean temperature was 55°.9, slightl below the normal October mean of the pas five years. The maximum temperature ob-
served, was 90°, recorded on the 10th, and wa the highest October maximum during the fiv years, except in 1884, when it reached 99D The minimum temperature was 22°, recorde on the 31st, and was, together with the Octobe minimum in 1884, the lowest in the above cor-
responding period. The monthly range o temperature was the greatest October rang during the above period, except in 1881 There were three cold-wave predictions durin the month, viz: 4th-5th, 24th-25th, and 29th-
30th, all of which were fully verified The mean precipitation for the month was
2.57 inches, slightly below the normal of th past five years. Of this amount the Easter division received an average of three and  quarter inches, the Middle division, two and  half inches, and the Western division, tw inches. The greatest rainfall was 5.60 inches,
reported at Fostoria, and the least was 1.22
inch, reported at Milan. The greatest rainfal in 24 consecutive hours, was 3.30 inches, re-
ported at Fostoria. on the 19th. The first hal of the month was almost rainless, slight show-

below low water of September 5th, 1863, 19t to 23d; monthly range, 2.1 foot The TT. S. Observer at Nashville reports th rainfall for October, 0.93 inch below the six-
teen-year average at his station, The averag annual rainfall is 50.88 inches; on November
1, there was a deficiency of 2.64 inches The new voluntary station at Vernon, in
Hickman county, has been changed to Nun-
nelly, a station on the railroad, a mile or tw east of Vernon. The new observer, Mr. H.
('. Thompson, promises to sustain the goo reputation of the station, lately in the hand of Mr. David L. Spence, who is now taking  course of studv in meteorology and astronom at VanderbiltUniversity. The station at Rid-
dleton, for nearly five years in the excellen hands of Mr. Sterling P, Fergusson, is now i charge of his younger brother, Mr. Frank K Fergusson, who also gives promise of uphold-
ing the interests of the Service during th absence of his brother. While it is to be regret-
ted that the Service in the State, temporaril loses Mr. Fergusson the elder, who has bee called to fill quite a responsible position at
Blue Hill Observatory, near Boston, Mass., i is gratifying to know that he is in a position t exercise the full extent of his zeal and enthu-
siam in the study of his favorite science, an that he will reflect due credit on himself an his State, there is little room to doubt. I his work, he very fortunately has, for hi immediate associate and preceptor, Mr. H Helm Clayton, another young Tennessean, wh has active charge of the work at the Observa-
tory, and whose earnest and energetic work i the interests of meteorology has been promptl recognised, and whose papers on the scienc have been widely copied in scientific journals,
and who is already in the front rank amon the young meteorologists of the country. I is peculiarly gratifying to note that these young
Tennesseans—formerly voluntary observers i the State Weather Service—have met wit such rapid recognition of their merits, an that the fame of their illustrious fellow Ten-
nessean, the great Prof. Maury, may be thei incentive to higher honors in the great scienc of meteorology. It is safe to say, the bes wishes of their co-laborers in the Service iu
Tennessee, attend them Summary of the Meteorological Repor of the State Board of Healt for October, 1887 Mean barometer, 30.09 inches Maximum observed, 30.38 iuches, at Milan,

Matter Look Out for Small-Pox The recent outbreak of small pox at Mor-
ganville, a town on the Louisville it Nashville
Railroad, a little south of Montgomery, Ala.,

November 18, 1887, occurs the following ex-
cellent review of one of the most important
Sanitary Congresses ever held in Tennessee:
At a meeting of the Board of Health las night, Secretary E. A. Cobleigh, M. D., rea the following interesting paper Mr. President and Gentlemen:
As your delegate to the American Public
Health Association, I went to Memphis o the 7th inst., and attended its sessions The Association was presided over bv tha distinguished scientific investigator, Major
George M. Sternberg, U. S. A.,and our meeting were held in the United States court room a the custom house. I joined the associatio your secretary, and by becoming a membe will obtain a bound copy of its proceedings s soon as issued from the press. This book is  large and valuable one and will contain muc information which it may be convenient fo us to draw upon hereafter in public healt matters.
I also, so far as I had opportunity, familiar-
ized myself with the working of the sanitar machinery of such cities as were represente in the Association, paying particular attentio in the limited time at my command to the ques-
tions of garbage and its disposal, slops, night soil,
the inspection of food animals and adulterate foods, sewer gas, quarantine, infectious dis-
eases and things of this character affecting th health of all cities and towns. Chattanooga a we all know is a growing and rapidly growin place, and in the very near future—aye, indee now—theseare tobequestions of vast and vita importance to us. In sanitation we lag behin and to-day are only in a crudely formative stag as to public hygiene. All this must be remedie and remedied very soon—and feeling the nee of studying these questions, for practical goo to my city, they had great interest to me. 1
not only gathered all the information possibl from the public meetings of the Association,
but I personally inspected the sewer system of

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLET IN Memphis, the details of her engineer's office,
and by elaborate private inquiries drew  vast fund of facts from the numerous gentle-
men in attendance who are officially and act-
ively engaged in the sanitation of many differ-
ent cities of varying size.
I submit herewith a map and printed circu-
lar giving detailed information about th whole system. For the low lying and leve portions of Chattanooga, as almost the entire
Fifth ward, the south-eastern part of the
Fourth ward and the western section of the
Third ward, the Waring system as used at
Memphis is practical, if it be demonstrated a the best and most economical. Ventilatio for sewer gas at Memphis is provided by la for each house above the roof, and they hav no trouble from this source. One point i this connection of practical interests—some o the cities represented at our meeting save t property owners large sums of money by run-
ning their sewers mainly through the alley instead of the streets. By this meaus the dis-
turbance of pavements by repairs, and of side-
walks by house connections is largely avoided,
and the proximity of the sewer to the wate closets and kitchen sinks, which are almos invariably in the rear part of the houses o yards, insures short house pipes aud less cos than long soil stems from the same house through the front yards and to the center of  wide street. With regard to sewer gas, on of the gentlemen of the health department of
Brooklyn, N. Y., told me that by a series o practical tests and experiments the healt office of that city had demonstrated that  pressure of only three and one-half pounds i the pipes is sufficient to force this gas back-
ward through a twenty-foot column of water He also informed me that in Brooklyn typhoi fever is most prevalent and fatal in the wealth-
iest sections of the city where the most costl houses and elaborate system of scientifi plumbing obtain. This lie attributes to th tight buildings, the greater modem conve-
niences they possess thus numerically increas-
ing the sewer pipes in the premises, and th fact that the occupants go off for months eac year to summer resorts and almost hermetic-
ally seal the houses in their absence, and tlie return to breathe the pent up accumulation of contaminated air without the rooms eve receiving thorough ventilation The next subject of interest to me was th question of garbage and its disposal—especial-
ly in the light of our health officer's state-
ment that something must be done by ou city after January 1st looking to a riddance o garbage, owing to the expiration of our pres-
ent lease of ground used tor dumping pur-
poses. The best plan I could learn of for dis-
posing of vegetable and animal garbage,
capable of food consumption for swine, is th system in use in several Massachusetts citie and Minneapolis, where larue stock-yards ar run outside the city limits for the feeding o hogs, either by the municipality, the count poor farms, or private individuals who pay th cities royalty for the privilege, and in eac case the plan proves profitable for all con-
cerned. The next most common and practi-
cal method of disposal is by dumping int lakes and rivers off of boats constructed fo the purpose, and by carts also adapted to suc working in the most expeditious way. Bu this plan everywhere arouses violent opposj-
tion, often litigation, and is open to the seri-
ous objection of more or less obstructing Sow-
ing streams and pollution of the water suppl below the dumping ground The last plan, and the one rising into great-
est favor because it disposes of every characte of garbage except old tin and other incombus-
tibles, is by burning in peculiarly constructe furnaces. This is a method open to few ob-
jections, is just now perfected, is economica and disposes also of ashes, rags, leather an even night soil in large quantities, and afte starting the furnace up it affords its own fue from the rubbish supplied to it. I am to hav illustrations and descript ive circulars of thes furnaces by mail in a day or two, and will fil the same with this report for future referenc by the board The removal and ultimate disposition o night soil in a city like Chattanooga with it hundreds of vaults, is a question of vital im-
port even now, and growing greater year b year. It is something that ought to be reache effectively by the board of health an city council very soon and be regulated b stringent laws. On this subject T can say ver little, despite its importance. Of course, a our sewer system grows this evil decreases, ex-
cept as it extends constantly beyond the sewe limits by accretion of inhabtants. The mos economical plan of riddance for night soil i that obtaining where farmers are glad to get i for composting and fertilizing purposes, es-
pecially market gardeners, and in such town the health authorities absolutely make th privilege of removing night soil a source o revenue by selling licenses to a few persons a good prices. Tn Springfield, Mass., Dr. Bic gets (in a cityjust the size of Chattanooga) $50
a year each from ten men for this work They employ as many carts as they need unde very rigid regulations, and make their profi both off the property owner who has to pa them a ice for cleaning up his premises an the surrounding farmers who buy their nigh soil. The municipal health board, however,
supervises the entire system and directs thes men what premises need cleaning and when t do it. The only other plans for this work ar by dumping in water courses, burying i trenches away from the center of population,
or burning as before mentioned, and the las is the best of the three Among other things of moment that cam before the Association for consideration, bu which I will merely mention in pass ins, were
"death certificates and burial permits, thei necessity in large cities and their forms," and

the inspection of food cattle and foods to pre-
vent diseases and detect adulterations. Bot of these, and particularly the last, are worth of our consideration. The first we alread have in good practical shape. The latter i important to Chattanooga and ought to receiv the legislative attention of the boards of healt and aldermen, especially when the new mar-
ket-house opens. It is a matter of every da observation that stale fruits, decayed vege-
tables, diseased poultry aud ancient eggs ar exposed for sale on our streets—yes, and ar actually bought and consumed (as 1 have bee assured by dealers) by a class of the populatio who will buy anything that seems cheap an who furnish the bulk of our mortality tables All this should be obviated in the interest o public health The subject of quarantine just now is a mo-
mentous one. Only recently this whole natio stood in suspense, jealously and anxiousl watching the result of quarantine at the por of New York. Happily the outcome ther was a victory for the officials and a triump for science. I wish I had time to give yo a minute account of the interesting details,
both of that station and the one below New
Orleans, including the short sighted parsi-
mony of those who furnished funds for equip-
ping and operating the New York establish-
ment (because no actual epidemic was at thei doors) and the vast difficulties its officials sur-
mounted in successfully stamping out th pestilence which threatened invasion. Not th least of these difficulties was the active an concerted opposition of the immigrants them-
selves to all measures looking to their welfare,
with grim hatred manifested toward all doc-
tors as in their native land, during the whol epidemic, lasting now for two years, and thei secretiveness by which cholera victims droppe dying off their feet before the medical officer could ever learn that they were complaining But I have not time to elaborate on these matter in this paper. I can merely say that it wa the general sense of the Memphis conventio that we, as a nation, are to face the dangers o a cholera epidemic next year. Nothing bu the stern intervention of the general govern-
ment by refusing to allow infected vessels t touch our coasts is regarded as affording ade-
quate protection from the invasion of the Asi-
atic scourge. And it is considered doubtfu whether the government has the right unde existing treaties and under the laws of mari-
time commerce to take such a radical cours of dealing with the danger. Wherefore quaran-
tine stations are being reinforced, and th guns of the batteries of science are bein trained and double-shotted to cope, we hope,
triumphantly with the unwelcome foe. Ever possible precaution will be taken and every-
thing done that science can suggest and skil apply, to absolutely ward off from United
States soil the least trace of infection. Al this is good and right, but it has been don before and the history of the past tells us tha it was ultimately futile then aud probably wil be so again. And if history repeats itself th grim destroyer will enter by some route—per-
haps at an obscure and unguarded point—an then, without prompt and heroic measures o suppression, his march is sure. Now it ha been suggested to me that capital is timid an the agitation of this question "hurts trade"
by preventing investments. That was an argu-
ment used during the war at almost every wa measure that was broached. It is the argu-
ment that permits puerile inaction to sap one' strength in the face of danger and leaves one' forces powerless when the time comes for act ion It is tne argument of the individual dolla against the public weal, against the welfare o the great masses and the commonwealth Better stare stern reality in the face aud " i time of peace prepare for war."
The danger is not to Chattanooga or New
Orleans or any one locality in particular, tha capital should tremble and avoid that place,
but to the whole nation, and it behooves us t be up and doing now so that when cholera
—if come it shall—our city and our sectio shall be prepared to ward it off altogether i possible by a perfect system of sanitation,
cleanliness and quarantine. Thus we do no frighten capital or injure business, but we con-
serve the welfare of both capital and business,
and prevent a publicpanic, stampede and com-
mercial calamity. Forewarned is forearmed Let us reason as men and not like boys, prov-
ing pennywise and pound foolish. It is to late for effective sanitary work when the pesti-
lence is upon us. The work must be don during the coming winter aud spring, and the we are ready for cholera and may absolutel keep it away from our city by furnishing it n soil for propagation. The danger of invasio now is greater than ever before in the histor of this continent, for during 1887 cholera ha threatened us from Europe, South Americ and the Orient by the way of China in thre different directions, and has slowly drawn it toils nearer and nearer to our shores. The as the danger is increased so should the warn-
ing be heeded and the efforts at preventio magnified. Let a stitch be taken in time an thus save the proverbial nine. This is the feel-
ing of health authorities all over the land, an every where increased activity in sanitary meas-
ures of cities is being inaugurated, and this is th very best sign of the times one could ask, bod-
ing well for the future And now if there is aught in this report o which you wish to hear from me more in de-
tail, I am ready to respond verbally at you commaud. E. A. Cobleioh,
Secretary.

SCBSPRII'TION.
25c PEK ANNUM Entered at the Pofltoffiofl at Nashville ns second Class Matter Climatology Elsewhere in this i-suc will be found the Hoard' meteorological report for 1887, in addition to th monthly report for December. The data thu presented is of much value, as it is from a contin-
uous record of this kind alone that it becomes pos-
sible to study with profit those vital, varied an complex questions which are involved in any in-
telligent consideration of the subject—climate Upon July 18, 1885, the State Board of Health,
upon the solicitation of Hon. A. J. MeWhirter,
Commissioner of Agriculture, assumed control o the then called "State Weather Service," th chief inducement to do so was to enlarge its scop of scientific application; that is, while continuin and so far as possible increasing its benefits to th agricultural and live stock interests in the State,
to utilize the data collected in defining the advan-
tages and benefits of our salubrious and equabl climate upon human health and longevity. Cli-
matic changes and atmospheric conditions hav from the earliest periods been recognised as im-
portant factors in modifying or causing many o the diseases affecting the bodies of men or animals It has been customary to connect the great epi-
demics with atmospheric peculiarities. Whil atmospheric changes may not be the immediat cause of diseases of the contagious type, they ma very considerably influence the effects of the tru causes of those diseases, and this specially in re-
gard to the mortality induced by the diseases. Th class of diseases springing directly from atmos-
pheric causes and the class springing from conta-
gion is often very refined and it would appear pos-
sible, if not probable, that some diseases which ar induced by atmospheric variations may pass int the diseases which are communicable by contagion Common cold or catarrh is one of these diseases o the border line. That common cold is sometime communicable from one |K?rson to another is a hypothesis based on repeated observation, and tha from common cold other diseases, more distinctl contagious, such as influenza, may arise, is  theory resting on a good basis of fact. This wor the State Board of Health have undertaken, and t that end they have organized a Meteorological De-
partment, to which Private H.C. Bate,Signal Corps,
has been assigned to duty as assistant upon the orde of Chief Signal Officer A. W. Greely, U. S. A.

which was ordered filed:
Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, January 3, 1888 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health i
Sir—When the reports for December are printe an approximate analysis of sickness in Tennesse for the year 1887 may be bad, somewhat frag-
mentary, indeed, yet of much value and interes because of the great variety, geologically and cli-
matically, which characterizes the State It is to be regretted that our correspondents d not take time and pains to make their report more full and definite. Until the much neede registration of births, deaths and marriages is es-
tablished, these reports are the sole means o forming an opinion as to health and sickness i the State Early in February, 1886, a communication from
President Plunket as follows was sent to eacl county health officer in the State:
"Dear Sir—It is the desire of the State Boar of Health to publish hereafter in th<> Bulletin  monthly summary of the health in Teunessee. T do so at all satisfactorily, it is necessary thai ever county should be heard from. You are therefor asked to mail a statement as to the healthfulness o your county so far as you may have personal know-
ledge or hearsay will enable you to state, for th month just past. Give the prevailing disease and give them in the order of their greater prev-
alence. This data, it is true, will De far fro accurate, but, as a general indicator, it will pos-
sess a relative value, and will constitute in realit a practical beginning of what in time we hope t secure—a complete system of vital statistics fo the State.
"Your cordial co-operation is respectfully so-
licited, and upon the first of each month, begin-
ning with the first of March proximo, and so o for every month thereafter, please mail to this of-
fice your report, thus allowing ample time for it reception here and arrangement in proper for for publication. The Bulletin goes to press o the 5th of each month."
This request has been followed up steadily b the issuance and careful circulation of the Bul-
letin for the nearly two years since passed During the last quarter special letters have bee sent to all our correspondents, making Buch sug-
gestions in each case as might seem uece?sary As in 1886 so in 1887, Tennessee has been en-
tirely free from small-pox, not a single case, eve of varioloid, having been reported. This exemp-
tion will probably lead to carelessness in usin preventive measures, which carelessness in tur will be followed by disastrous consequences The year has been marked by signficant pre-
monitions of yellow fever. The events at Key
West and at Tampa in Florida, while illustratin notably the efficacy of modern scientific vigilanc and sanitary precaution in checking the spread o a much dreaded pestilence, speak loudly as  warning of threatened danger. Eight years hav now elapsed since yellow fever scourged one fa-
mous city and frightened the entire Southland It is time to look out As to cholera, the people of the entire Unio and Dominion are on the qui vive. Its prolonge existence in Europe and its ravages in South
America are universally recognized as a doubl menace to the United States and Canada. The

STATE 'BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
telegraphic columns of the daily press give to ou millions every fact concerning its spread or prev-
alence. The people are more alarmed than Board of Health Wc can not be surprised at this uneasiness; fo where is the populous city or country village i tit sanitary condition to meet thisor any virulen epidemic?
When the well established fact is called to min that the daily and systematic carrying out of san-
itary measures in home, hospital or city dimin-
ishes liability to many diseases and greatly pro-
motes recovery from any and all ailments, th stupidity and lethargy of municipal authorities,
big and little, can never be sufficiently admired.
I submit herewith a communication from th secretary of " The National Pure Food Movement,"
requesting the co-operation of this Board in th convention to be held in Washington, D. C.,-Jan-
uary 19th. Also one from the secretary of the
"National Conference of State Boards of Health,"
in reference to the meeting in June, 1888 By request of Dr. P. D. Sims, I visited Chatta-
nooga, November 28th, and with him conferre with the local Board of Health, the mayor, an members of the city council, as to the sanitar wants of that rapidly growing centre of manu-
factures and commerce. Much interest was man-
ifested by all concerned. Time will show th result The following counties have as yet not complie with the law making it obligatory to establis county Boards of Health: Anderson, Cheatham,
Claiborne, Clay, Dickson, Fentress, Grundy, Hen-
derson, Hickman, Meigs, Monroe, Trousdale,
Union and Warren. The chairman of eac county court has been recently written to and hi attention called to the statute, so that the defec may be remedied at the quarterly session held i the current month There are mauy neat, beautiful and growin towns in Tennessee which should have sanitar laws and registers of vital statistics, as in Cali-
fornia, Ohio and other States. Michigan h:is ove twelve hundred local boards Great progress would be made in public healt if each incorporated town in Tennessee should a once carry out the spirit of the act establishing
• this Board in 1877. That act makes it obligator upon every municipality having five thousand in-
habitants to organize a Board of Health whic shall act in concert with the State Board. Tulla-
homa has recently set a good example in this re-
spect Wide experience has Bhown that small village and towns need public health regulations no les imperatively than great cities The following additions have been made to th library of the Board during the last quarter:

tesian wells of Memphis Dr. Sims, who at the last meeting was in-
structed to originate and organize measure for the sanitation of the city of Chattanooga,

Movement Association, and from the National
Conference of State Boards of Health, and th appointment of delegates was referred to th hxecutive Committee After examining the accounts for the pas quarter, the Board adjourned to meet on April
3,1888 Chemistry of Food and its Adulterations.
BY DANIEL F. WRIflHT, M. D So far we have considered food exclusiv with reference to its chemical constitution,
but te understand the qualities which facili-
tate its digestion and its assimilation as an or-
ganic portion of the vital tissues, to appreciat the value of different modes of combinatio and preparation, wo must give some attentio to the digestive and assimilative function in the human body The most popular treatises on digestion hav discussed the subject simply iu reference t that process of solution which food undergoe in the stomach ; but this is a very partial vie of the subject; it is only one element of foo which is modified in that way, namely th protoplasmic element, and even that has to un-
dergo further processes before its elaboratio is complete. As, therefore, the functions o the stomach are more generally known tha those of other parts of the digestive tract, w shall allude to them very briefly, and stud more in detail the processes less generall known or thought of Mastication—Theprocessesof digestion com-
mence as soon as food is admitted into th mouth, and what is done there is far from un-
important. The first of these is mastication:
this is said to be a process habitually neglecte in these United States. Our dinner is gener-
ally taken during business hours, and is looke upon by business men as a most inconvenien interruption to more important matters; tim is therefore not taken either for that deliberat attention to mastication or for the subsequen rest which is essential to the further proces of digestion. Our food is disposed of as th dog eats: it is slightly lacerated and the bolted, when a rapid retreat from the dining-
table to the office or the counting-room fol-
lows. The food therefore does not stay lon enough in the mouth to be duly prepared fo further treatment in the stomach; that orga is therefore handicapped in its efforts to per-
form its own duties. Thorough mastication i necessary for two reasons: Unless the foo undergoes thorough and minute subdivisio in that process, neither can the fluids, whic should act upon it chemically and physically,
gain access to any part of it except its surface,
nor does any other part become absorbed int the system, but passes through the intestine and is discharged unchanged—producing n effect except that of irritating the surface wit which it comes in contact. But this is not th only loss sustained through defective mastica-
tion. The motions which should be devote to this purpose are also essential to promotin the flow of saliva, and therefore bring us t our second stage in digestion—that of
Intalivalion.—Saliva is furnished by severa different glands which pour their secretion into the mouth ; two of these will be here con-
sidered. One of them, the parotid gland, fur-
nishes the saliva which mainly exerts a chem-
ical action on the food. It acts on that class,
the carbo-hydrates, such as starch and sugar,
which abound most in our breadstuff's; thes it prepares for absorption by converting the into dextrine, in which form only they can b absorbed; the other, the sublingual gland, se-
cretes a viscid fluid used for lubricating th food-mass so as to promote its passage throug the gullet to the stomach.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Now to explain the connection of thisinsal-
ivation with mastication. The duct or tub by which the saliva from the parotid gland i thrown into the mouth is embedded in th muscular tissues of the cheek ; while these ar at rest it remains closed, but the motions o mastication pressing on the duct force th saliva through it into the mouth and so fur-
nish the necessary fluid exactly as it is wanted But if these motions are abridged, the saliv which should act upon the food, remains idl in the gland. That the motions of masticatio do promote the flow of saliva any one ca prove for himself. When the mouth become dry, which it often does from sleeping wit themouth open, you have only to go through th motions of chewing to find that saliva is rapidl put forth, and the more so if a piece of leathe or india-rubber is put in the mouth to exer-
cise the teeth upon Stomach.—Supposing, now, the food-mass,
softened and moistened with saliva, and wel crushed by the teeth, to have made a safe pas-
sage through the gullet and to be received i the stomach; now commences the process t to which is ordinarily limited the term diges-
tion. Let us consider what takes place there The food materials arrive there (supposing th previous process duly performed) with th carbo-hydrates partially converted into dex-
trine, or by a further process into sugar, th fat set free from the enveloping membrane o its globules and the protoplasm not yet dis-
solved but reduced to a very fine state of sub-
division, and all very thoroughly churned u and mixed together. On entering the stomac it undergoes an elaborate series of motions;
first it is carried by the action of the circula muscular fibres by a slow spiral route fro one extremity of the stomach to the other,
coming in contact successively with every spo on its surface, and so becoming subject to se-
cretion from all the glands and follicles whic abound on that surface. These glands ar of two classes; one producing pepsin, th other gastric juice. Tne former is the activ ingredient in digestion, its function is the so-
lution of protoplasm; in other words, th muscular fibre of the meat, the casein of mil and cheese, the albumen of eggs, all these pre-
viously in a solid though minutely subdivide condition are now dissolved and become fluid This solvent power however of the gastri juice can only be performed in an acid medium,
hence the necessity of of the gastric juic which always contains acetic, and sometime muriatic acid. If by the time the food arrive at the further extremity of the stomach an portion of solid substance remains undissolved,
its contact occasions a muscular contractio at that point which carries it back to the com-
mencing point, when the whole process is re-
sumed. If solution has not yet taken plac this is again repeated, but in case masticatio has boon neglected, after the contact of undi-
gested matter has beon too often repeated, ir-
ritability is exhausted and the food passes o undigested to the intestines, doing injury ther and no good anywhere—the stomach has. i fact, finally refused to do work which ough to have been done in the mouth Duodenum.—If the previous processes hav been duly preformed, the following is the con-
dition of the food when it arrives in the intes-
tine: The sugar and starch so far as it wa dissolved in the mouth is absorbed by th blood-vessels in the stomach and so enters th circulation. Any part of it that remains un-
dissolved continues in that condition whil passing through the stomach, as the secretion there are acid and the conversion of it int the dextrine requires the presence of an alka-
line fluid—it is resumed in the intestine. Th protoplasmic elements arrive here in solution,
and the fatty or oleaginous materials, as ye unchanged except by solution of the fin membranes which enveloping them keep the apart from one another, come along floating i the other fluids in the form of globules suc as can be seen when fat is shaken up in a vis-
cid fluid. This heterogeneous mixture i called chyme; it has now to be converted int chyle. This process takes place in the firs eight or ten inches of the intestine,"which por-
tion of it is called the duodenvm. Mechanic-
ally considered, the process is an emulsion It is precisely that which is effected when i an apothecary's shop an emulsion of castor oi has to be made. He mixes his oil with gu or starch, or what is better than either, th yolk of an egg, shakes and trituates them ver thoroughly together. The result is a thic creamy looking mixture in which most of th oil has disappeared, but a little of it is stil visible in the form of smallglobulesfloating i the mass. So long as these are visible to th naked eye, and especially if they reunite an float separately on the surface, the emulsifica-
tion is not complete, and it is frequently foun difficult to bring it to perfection, but the proc-
ess can be much facilitated by the addition o a very small quantity of any alkali, as soda o potassa The process of digestion in the duodenu is similar in all its steps to this. The food, a it comes from the stomach, consists mainly (a does the mixture of castor oil and egg) of pro-
toplasm in solution mixed, but not intimately,
with an oleaginous substance in floating glob-
ules. How this is done is shown by a study o the duodenum in which it takes place. Thi portion of the intestine is mainly distinguishe from the rest of the intestinal tract by the fac of its receiving the secretions of the liver an the pancreatic gland, the bile, in short, and th pancreatic juice. The action of these two se-
cretions in digestion must be examined sepa-
rately The bile, besides other substances not no to be discussed, contains two of primary im-
portance towards digestion, viz.: A larg quantity of soda and a resinous substanc which bears special relations to oily substances The use of the first is simply expressed. The

process now required, that of rendering fatt matters capable of intimately mixing in water solutions without subsequent separation, can-
not take place in the prssence of an acid, bu it will be remembered that the juices whic act upon the food in the stomach are acid an it comes from that organ with a highly aci reaction. It is for the purpose then of neu-
tralizing this acid and rendering the.fluid al-
kaline that the soda is required. The apothe-
caries are aware of this fact, and when throug their castor oil becoming partially rancid,
acids are developed in it, they cannot make  perfect emulsion, but soon remedy the diffi-
culty by adding a very small quantity of alkali,
such as soda or potash The other ingredieut in the bile is a sort o resin which has also a powerful influence i promoting the solubility of oils. Painters i oil colors are aware of this, and put it to prac-
tical use in the form of ox-gall with whic they soften and dissolve such colors as ma have become hard and dry The combined use, then, of these two bilar ingredients is to render the fatty substance soluble, in other words, to enable them to com-
bine with albuminous substances in solution The pancreatic juice.—The gland whic furnishes this secretion is very similar i structure to those which discharge the sali-
vary secretion into the mouth. The produc of its secretion is a "clear viscid-fluid o strongly alkaline reaction, and highly coagula-
ble by heat." It seems to be the most power-
ful catalytic ferment produced in the body,
for it is capable of effecting decomposition o all the three leading alimentary substances On carbo-hydrates it continues the diastati ferment commenced by the saliva; on the fatt principles it separates the glycerine from th fatty acids, and on the protoplasmic element it effects a decomposition of part and solutio of a greater part. The constituents of thi juice, which acts on the protoplasmic princi-
ples, is called trypsin, and differs strikingl from the pepsin in the stomach. Thus pepsi acts only in presence of an acid, trypsin onl in that of an alkali; trypsin, in fact, whe mixed with pepsin and gastric juice, not onl does not exert its characteristic action but i itself digested and decomposed. Further, pep-
sin simply dissolves protoplasm, trypsin de-
composes it.
I have dwelt the more in detail on thes chemical transformations effected by the pan-
creas because it is only of late that its secre-
tion has been supposed to act on any of th food elements except the fats. It appears no that it acts with energy on all of them, and s far as we can estimate its effects on them,
which are still very obscure, its chief en seems to be to bring into the most intimat and minutely associated relation the two im-
portant elements, protoplasmic and oleaginous,
the fat and the lean. iSoue of the higher tis-
sues of the body, such as the muscles an the brain are so constructed as to dispens with both these elements in intimate combina-
tion, and an examination of the chyle, whic is the'fluid resulting from the action of th bile and pancreatic juice upon the food ele-
ments as they come' from the stomach, show that such an intimate combination has bee effected, for the fluid is found to contain  large quantity of granules which require th highest powers of the microscope for their de-
tection, out which are then shown to consis of minute particles of fat each, coated wit a pellicle of protoplasm But it is not merely a chemical and mechan-
ical action which seems to be originated in th duodenum. The phenomena of life now firs manifest themselves. It has been stated—
rather more broadly, I think, than truly, tha new nutritious material is simply dead matte and external to the organization so long as i remains in the intestinal tract. It is admitte that blood is a living constituent of the body,
but not so the fluids in the intestine. On th contrary, I contend that the characteristics o life commence their developments in the duo-
donum. It is here that cell life commences,
and that contractility, the very primary mani-
festation of vitality, exhibits itself. Here ar for the first time detected bodies exactly re-
sembling the colorless corpuscles of th blood, and here the fluid portion of the magm first becomes coagulable, forming a clot whe separated from the body, which under th microscope exhibits the same fibrinous strut -
ure as the fluid portion of the blood doe when coagulated It is true that these signs of life are mor feebly manifested in the chyle than in th blood, but they are there, and if the one flui is alive so is the other; they gain force as th chyle passes through the lacteals; the mesen-
teric glands, the thoracic duct aud its recep-
taculum, so that the corpuscles become lar-
ger and the coagulation firmer and the fibrin more abundant; but this is only a question o degree—the life begins in the duodenum It was hoped that the present paper woul complete our disquisition on the hygiene o food, but it has been found as we proceede with the subject that the philosophy of diges-
tion had to be discussed at greater length tha we anticipated in order to give a rational ac-
count of healthy methods in the preparatio and administration of food, and, as our spac is limited, we are compelled to postpone tha for another issue of the Bullktin.

in the north-eastern portion of the county. Thes have been the most prevalent diseases Fentress county—No board organized Franklin county—Dr. J. C. Shapard, Counly
Health Officer, Winchester.—During the month of
January, pneumonia was not so prevalent as it ha been during the two or three preceding months But there were some very severe cases of typhoi fever, in two of which ha-iuorrhage from the bow-
els came on and death resulted Measles pre-
vailed quite extensively but in mild form; mump were also met with occasionally; and strange t say, jaundice was of as frequent occurrence as i had been for several months previous; such  prevalence of jaundice as ha* existed here for som months was never before known in the history o this county Gibson county—Dr. T.J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—As Health Officer of Gibso county, I would report a little more than an aver-
age amount of sickness for the month of January;
this is largely due to the general prevalence of ru-
beola in nearly all sections of the county. In an around Trenton the cafes are now being numbere by the score. The disease is mild in type ; only  few cases have suffered from any complications,
and those have been easily traceable to impru-
dence. In connection with rubeola, roseola als prevails, and cases of the latter are at times mis-
taken for the former. Dr. T. J. Moore, of Brad-
ford, reports measles as the prevailing disease o his neighborhood. A few cases of typhoid feve are still on hand. I have under observation on family in which, including cases now on hand,
there have been nine cases. The family was tha of a negro—a small house with only two rooms,
had hygienic surroundings, and an utter impossi-
bility to scatter the inmates—one death has occur-
red. In one white family I have two cases, no convalescing. A few cases of pneumonia are re-
ported. In my own practice I have had three
-cases of lobular pneumonia in small children,
Independent of measles. Tonsilitis and fauciti are frequently reported Milan—M. D. L. Jordan, M. D.—A widesprea epidemic of measles is prevailing over a larg extent of country, with a few deaths from pneu-
monia as a complication. Whooping-cough i prevalent but subsiding. A few cases of pneu-
monia but no deaths, only as above mentioned Trenton—A. S. Currey, Esq.— Health continue good for the season. A few cases of pneumoni and typhoid fever within the last ten days. Mea-
sles have appeared in Trenton, as yet in mild form,

Health Officer, Chattanooga.—The prevailing dis-
eases in this portion of Hamilton county for th month of January, 1888, have been lung diseases,
acute and chronic. The number of deaths fro zymotic diseases still shows a marked decrease Reports of physicians and others indicate a health month Chattanooga—Dr. E. A. Gobleigh, Secretary City
Board of Health.—I have to report for January  rather favorable state of municipal health. Ther is a continued predominance of diseases due t climatic vicissitudes, as catarrhs, bronchial ail-
ments, pleuritic attacks and pneumonias. Th winter also shows a persistence of hepatic, diar-
rheal and dysenteric disturbances, unusual for th season. Rheumatism, remittent fever and othe malarial disorders are occasionally met but are no of markedly frequent occurrence. A rather war but very wet winter predisposes to these types of dis-
ease existing; and tubercular cases show a genera tendency to aggravation at present. Taken all i all, January starts the new year as a pretty health one here Hancock counly—Dr. Jesse B. Mitchell, Countv
Health Officer, Datura.—The health of Hancoc county for January was comparatively good. Som cases of catarrhal pneumonia and mumps reporte in north-west part of county. Except abov named mumps nothing of an epidemic character There has been an occasional case of bilious fever,
and some few cases of a typho-malarial character Haideman county—Dr. Jas. J. Neely, Jr., Countv

erable sickness during last month. The disease*
mostly of pulmonary character, such as pneumonia,
bronchitis, and alto a few cases of typhoid fever Two prominent men of our county died of pneu-
monia. One death from paralysis. A majorit of cases yielded readily to medical treatment Haywood county—Dr. J. H. Howell, County

monia. Mean temperature 34°.8 Rain and sleet-
fall heavy ; sleet remaining on ground 16 days Maury county—Dr. W. C. Dorsett, County Health
Officer, Columbia.—Pneumonia was the most prev-
alent serious disease during January; a good man cases being typhoid in character, with fatality i some. Measles and whooping-cough also exist t a limited extent. Five cases of cerebro-spina meningitis, with two deaths therefrom, have bee reported to me, and one case of genuine hydro-
phobia, (occurring 56 days after a dog bite, wit death on the third day); in addition to this, th usual amount of comparatively trivial affection ncident to the season, such as bronchitis, croup,
rheumatism, have occurred without noticeabl fatality Columbia—Hon. Robert Pillow, M. D., City
Health Officer.—The health of Columbia for Jan-
uary was fair; measles, chicken-pox, mumps an epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis have been th prevailing troubles MeMinncounty—Dr. E. S. Shipley,County Health
Officer, Athens.—The month of January passe away without any particular prevalence of diseas in our county except colds, and of this we have a abundance; a few cases of pneumonia are reported,
but it was by no means prevalent. Perhaps  larger number of consumption have succumbe than usual, which is probably attributable to th prevailing epidemic, catarrh. LaGrippe woul teem to be a very appropriate name for the pre-

Officer, Kismet.— Health of county not so good a during December. Numerous cases of catarrha fever, and one or two reported as typhoid. Tw deaths to report from consumption Oit'on county—Dr. A. B. Wedlington, acting
County Health Officer, Troy.—Obion county i sorely afflicted with an epidemic of measles o quite a malignant form. Quite a number of death are reported from all parts of the county as a resul of this disease. Union City is suffering extensivel with this disease, and a great many deaths wer caused by it. Pneumonia, bilious and malaria fevers are the other principal diseases. Taking al-
together, this month has more sickness than i common for this time of the year Obion Independent, Obion, Feb. 2, '88: Measles ha been raging in Obion county without cessation fo more than a year. It has found its way to ever nook and corner of the county, and the fatalit registered to the credit of this annoying pestilenc is astonishing and unprecedented. Especially ha this disease been fatal where the victims live i poorly arranged houses without the proper facilitie of taking care of themselves. Many who hav escaped death are left with shattered constitution and almost hopeless and debilitated and ruine health. As to how long this terrible disease wil remain among us is problematical, especially s long as the people are imprudent. Social gather-

Matter Chemistry of Food and Its Adulterations.
BT DANIEt P. WRIGHT, M. D Having completed our investigation of th chemical properties of the food elements an of the processes they go through during di-
gestion, we have now to consider the form i which they are best adapted to the sustenanc of the human system. This implies the
SELECTION, PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRA-
TION Of FOOD It has already been shown that the chem-
ical constitution of food alone does not deter-
mine our conclusions on these subjects. Man,
the tiger and the ox are alike nourished wit protoplasm hydro-carbons and fatty sub-
stances, yet their food is different; the tige cannot live on grass, nor the ox on raw flesh,
nor man on either; so that the health of eac animal depends upon the form in which thes elements are presented to it. Man is th being whose food is now under consideration,
and the subject is much more complicated i his case than in that of any other animal This complication is determined by two cir-
cumstances:
1. Man is omnivorous.
2. 1 lis food requires cookery.
1. Man is omnivorous. This has been dis-
puted, and it is only within certain limitation that it is true; but practically, man in his ali-
mentary characteristics is an omnivorous ani-
mal; he is capable of applying to his nutri-
tion all those natural products which furnis food to other animals It is true that human life can be supporte on either animal or vegetable food alone, bu such is certainly not his typical or most ad-
vantageous diet. As this bus been dispute by a certain dietetic school, the.vegetarians,
we will devote some limited space to its con-
sideration. The fitness of food for the nutri-
tion of this or that animal system depend upon the proportions in which the protoplas-
mic elements and those destitute of proto-
plasm are mixed in it. Vegetable food gen-
erally contains very little protoplasm in pro-
portion to its total mass, while animal food i nearly all protoplasm except the water, whic all organic substances largely contain. Hence,
to gain a given quantity of protoplasm a muc larger quantity of vegetable than of anima food must be consumed. Since, then, all ani-
mals require for the reparation of their bodil waste nearly the same amount of protoplasm,
herbivorous animals must consume a muc greater mass of food than carnivorous, and th structure of their digestive organs differs ac-
cordingly, The ox with his capacious paunc and his four stomachs and his great length o intestines is capable of containing an immens quantity of food, while the wolf or tiger has  very simply constructed stomach and a muc shorter intestine, which can nevertheless eon-
tain enough of his food for his wants becaus the indispensable protoplasm is very muc more concentrated in his flesh diet than in th grass which fills the herbivorous stomach Now, man's digestive organs, intermediat between the two, approach much more nearl the carnivorous than the herbivorous type,
hence they cannot receive, without much in-
convenience, enough vegetable food to furnis the requisite amount of protoplasm. This i a fact I have myself had the opportunity o observing in person, having at one time board-
ed in the same house with a rigid vegetarian,
and having been astounded with the enormou quantity of bread and vegetables which h consumed, and which it took nearly the res of the day for him to digest and dispose of In short, comparative anatomy alone is quit sufficient to dispose of the vegetarian theor as a regimen for man, and the argument o that basis could be extended to much greate length if I had the time and space to devot to it On the other hand, that man can sustain lif on a purely carnivorous diet is quite true as

an abstract statement; that any large portio of the human race does do so, or that th whole human race could be supplied with car-
nivorous aliment in its present condition is a exceedingly doubtful proposition. It is tru that in the case of such savage tribes as liv by hunting, a very large portion of their sub-
sistence is from animal food; but with ver few even of such savages is it unmixed. The
Indians of this continent were certainly in th jjossessiun of maize and used it as food lon before the access of European nations, an the pre-historic people who inhabited the lak dwellings in Europe have left among thei reliques, so wonderfully discovered, severa species of grain stored up. If there are an known races of men who live entirely on ani-
mal food they are the Esquimaux and the Fue-
gians of the cold regions of the extreme Nort and South and the Andaman islanders, th coast tribes of which seem to live almost ex-
clusively on fish. But even the Esquimau supplement their meals of bear meat, seals'
flesh and fat with the bark of the birch an other trees ground to a sort of meal. In an case, the three races enumerated are amon the most degraded on earth The cause of the insufficiency of an absolut animal diet for human sustenance is that  much larger quantity has to be consumed tha if supplemented by some hydrocarbons, inas-
much as animal heat has to be supplied by th consumption of a large quantity of protoplas-
mic food in addition to what is used for Dod-
ily repair.
2. Mans food requires cookery. The pos-
sibility of man's subsistence for a time o some kinds of food without the agency of fir will not be disputed. Let it suffice for ou resent purpose that no race of man has ye een discovered entirely without some for of cookery. Even the cave-dwellers assigne to the interglacial periods of pre-historic geol-
ogy have left behind them heaps of burn bones, indicating their possession of fire an its use in the preparation of food. It ma moreover be shown that the art of cooker has rendered innumerable substances capabl of being used as food which must otherwis have been left for consumption by the lowe animals as incapable of digestion by hu-
man stomachs; and this limitation regardin the sources of food must have much limite the human population of the earth, leaving  sparsely scattered race of human beings il supplied with the means of competing wit the then preponderant brute creation for it means of subsistence, and itself scarcely ye advanced beyond the standard of brutal life We find ourselves again called upon to apol-
ogize for our inability to finish this course o papers in the present issue, the theoretica preliminaries having occupied an amount o space which compels us to defer to a future
Bulletin the discussion of their practical ap-
plication.

Health Officer, Winchester.—The month of Feb-
ruary was characterized by an extensive preva-
lence of measles in this place and the surroundin country. Students almost without number an whole families have suffered with the disease, bot in town and in the country. The disease has no been considered to be of a very severe form, bu perhaps an unusual number of those suffering wit it have ventured out too soon and have subse-
quently suffered, with most often lung troubles,
but in some cases with diarrhoea. The disease i still progressing without any abatement. Not  case of typhoid fever reported during the month,
nor a case of pneumonia, unconnected with mea-
sles. Two cases of jaundice in early part of month Gibson county—Dr. T.J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—For February in Trenton an its immediate vicinity, I would report a stead spread of rubeola. More than one hundred case have already occurred in the corporate limit with so far only one death. The disease so fa has been confined almost exclusively to the whit population. The later cases are more severe an show a decided tendency to complications—capil-
lary, bronchitis and pneumonia. As sequences I
have found a number of cases of otorrhea. I connnection with this epidemic of rubeola, roseol in a severe form occurs, and is in some cases mis-
taken for the former. Dr. Moore, of Bradford, re-
ports the continued spread of measles. Such a gen-
eral epidemic was never before known in West
Tennessee. Dr. J. W. Penn, of Humboldt, report health in that section unusually good. Tonsiliti is more frequent than in January. No new case of typhoid fever—one death resulted from it All cases in the negro family referred to in Janu-
ary report, have recovered. I am trying to organ-
ize a county system of health reports, but hav not succeeded well so far. Physicians do not tak the interest in such matters that they ought Milan—M. D. L. Jordan,M. D.—A few linge ing cases of measles in the country. Otherwise,
the health is good except a few cases of pneu-

Health Officer, Pulaski —The month of Februar had an unusual amount of sickness in the tow and county. Roseola has prevailed as an epi-
demic, and a great many cases of catarrhal pneu-
monitis and catarrhal fever have occurred.

I there has been any unusual features in the healt of the county it is the increased number of chroni and sab-acute rheumatic troubles. Chronic rheu-
matism of a rather nervous kind, together wit neuralgia, has been unusually common through
February. Otherwise, the health of the count has been as good as common for the season Hardeman county—Dr. Jas. J. Neely, Jr., County

Health Officer, Waverly.—The health of our coun-
ty for the month of February has been so goo that I am almost at a loss for something to report.
A very few cases of measles, mumps, bilious, in-
termittent fever, catarrhal troubles and some rheu-
matism, all of which have been very mild, n deaths having occurred from them On receipt of the nolice from the State Board of
Health after writing the above, I went at once to-
the Knoxville College and made as full an inves-
tigation of the recent outbreak of typhoid feve as I could under existing circumstances. I regre that I did not learn of the epidemic sooner, as a earlier investigation would have been mure satis-
factory. Through the kindnessof Rev. J. S. McCuI-
loch, the worthy President, I was greatly assiste in my efforts in investigating the sanitary condi-
tion of the institution. We first directed our at-
tention to the sewers; from thence to the water-
closets and other places where effete matters wer disposed of, and lastly through one of the colleg buildings; all of which seemed to be in tirst-class.
sanitary condition. I am satisfied that the caus of the fever could not have originated from any o the above sources. Upon further inquiry, I learne that in the early part of the winter, during dr weather, the water in the cisterns became ex-
hausted, and that, unfortunately, they were re-
supplied with water from a creek, taken a shor distance below a slaughter-pen. The creek bein very low, was no doubt contaminated with putre-
faction from the pen. Contaminated water wa the most probable cause. That the cause wa local there seems to be no doubt, as all the case occurred in the college premises except one, wh went into the city and died there. I am sorr thaf a satisfactory analysis of the water could no be made. The cisterns had been emptied, excep one, in which very little water remained, and tha very much diluted with rainwater. Out of thir-
teen teachers, three look the fever, and out of on hundred and forty students, twenty-two cases oc-
curred, five resulting fatally. No new cases sinc the 2: d of February Knoxville— Dr. S.B. Boyd, City Health Officer.—

SE-FOK-T FOB FEBS,TJ^.K,"X", 1888 The month of February was characterize by a large percentage of cloudiness, hig winds and disagreeable weather generally The mean temperature was 44°.5, slightl above the mean of the past five years. It wa about 5° lower than the February mean of las venr, but was 8° higher than that of 1886, an nearly 11° higher "than that of 1885. Th highest temperature was 71°, recorded at va-
rious stations, on the 17th, 18th and 19th, an was the lowest February maximum during th last five years except that of 1886. which was
70°. The lowest temperature was 4°, recorde on the 28th. With the exception of last yea it was the highest February minimum durin the past five years, the lowest during that tim being in 1886, when the remarkable and per-
haps unprecedented record of 22° below zer was reported. The minimum reported las year was 20° above zero, making a differenc of 42' in the February minimums of the tw years. The mean daily range was slightly les than the normal of five years There were four cold waves during th mouth, two of which came without any warn-
ing, viz: 24th-25th and 26th-28th. In bot instances—but particularly in the latter—
there was a very decided fall in temperature,
and on the last named date the lowest temper-
ature of the mouth was recorded—indeed, a several stations, the lowest of tiie winter wa reported, notably at Greeueville, Rogersville,
Knoxville, Grief, Parksville, Rugby and Chat-
tanooga, of the Eastern Division, and Riddle-
ton, of the Middle Division. The cold wave of the 7th and 11th were fully verified, but a some of the stations of the Western Divisio the warnings were reported as not being re-
ceived far enough in advance The mean rainfall was 3.45 inches, nearl two inches less than the February mean of th past five years, the greatest during that perio being 8.45 inches in 1B84, and 8.03 inches las year, and the least 2.39 iuches in 1885. O this amount the Eastern Division received a average of about four inches, the Middle Di-
vision about three and a half inches, and the
Western Division about two and a half inches The greatest monthly rainfall was 5.34 inche reported at Andersonville, and the least was
1.90 inch reported at Milan. The greates rainfall in twenty-four consecutive hours was
2.00 inches, reported on the 9th at Fostoria The days of greatest rainfall were the 3d, 7th,
10th, 11th, 19th and 24th, and of these th greatest fall occurred on the 19th. Most o the rains during the month were general,
though comparatively light, only a few sta-
tions reporting over one inch of daily rainfall On the 26th and 27th there were falls of slee and snow; the greatest depth reported for th month was 3.52 inches at Cookeville. Sligh falls of snow and sleet were reported durin the first decade at a few stations. Frosts wer reported at various stations on nineteen days,
the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 19th, 20th, 23d, 24th.
and 25th being the days on which none wa reported. Most of these were heavy or kill-
ing The feature of the month was the thunder-
storm of the 19th, which prevailed wit greater or less severity throughout the West-
ern and Middle portions of the State and  small portion of the Eastern Division. It wa quite severe in the northern portion of the
Western Division, and the northwestern por-
tion of the Middle Division, and extende into Southwestern Kentucky, where it wa very severe. The following extracts fro some of the State papers are made:
Centerville (Hickman county) Pioneer, 24th:
During the storm last Sunday night about 9
o'clock, Mrs. Isabella Cantrell, wife of Brown
Cantrell, in Gray's Bend, was killed by light-
ning. Nothing definite as to the exact man-
ner of the occurrence can be learned, as he husband and four children, who were sleep-
ing in the same room with her, did not kno she was out of bed till they were awakened b the shook of the electricity and found th wife and mother lying with her head near th fireplace, dead. No marks or contusion wer found on her person to indicate the work o the destructive agent; every bone in her bod seemed broken. The bolt went through th roof of the house near the corner of the roo and down through the floor into the cellar Two dogs sleeping under the floor were kille by the same bolt, also a duck and a chicken Springfield Record, 23d: We learn that  terrific cyclone passed through the 17th dis-
trict of this county between the hours of 8

and 9 o'clock last Sunday night. It tore dow tobacco barns, fences, forest trees, etc., to a alarming extent. At Mr. M. L. Killebrew' not a barn, stable or cabin was left. A cabi on his place, in which a family of negroe were asleep, was utterly demolished, but for-
tunately not one of the inmates was disabled Its course was from the southwest and it track about 150 yards in width Clarksville Semi-weekly Democrat, 20th:
The rain and hailstorm which visited us las night was one of unusual severity and di considerable damage, not in our own city, bu in the surrounding country, especially in th vicinity of Lafayette, Ky., where houses wer unroofed and blown down. The galvanize shutters placed on the new Christian churc liere were blown down and hurled against th idjacent house with great violence. At Pem-
broke, Ky., the storm was also unusually se-
vere, blowing down barns and houses an doing untold damage Ularksville Semi-weekly Tobacco Leaf,
21st: Sunday, the 19th inst., was the anniver-
sary of the twin storms of 1884, when a num-
ber of houses in the city were blown down,
others unroofed, and several persons injure by the falling timbers. Our people had no forgotten the terrible ordeal of that day, an the threatening indications on Sunday—th rapid changes from sunshine to shower, an the lowering elements and the rolling thunder
—recalled the former event. About 7:30 P.
M. a spring thunder storm passed over th city. This was followed by a tierce wind, ac-
companied with an exceptionally heavy fall o hail, after which a hard rain set in, but n damage of any consequence was done in th city. Other parts of the county did not es-
cape as did Clarksville, and at Lafayette, Ky.,
twenty miles northwest of here, serious dam-
age was reported. At this point the stor had the character of a tornado, sweeping ove the place in an instant, and leaving no hous in its track unscathed. Here it was apparent-
ly one-fourth of a mile wide, and nearly al evidences of it disappeared two miles from
Lafayette. It was a omit 7:40 p. M. that th quiet little town was rudely shaken up. For-
tunately the threatening elements had kep everyone in-doors, and there is no loss of lif to report, though the escapes were miraculous Great oaks that had brave the storms for years were twisted off some fee above the ground as if they had been pipe-
stems, and their bodies and tops sent whirl-
ing in the air. Several persons were more o less hurt, but no serious injuries are reported.
(Here follows list of dwellings and stores,
churches, barns, stables, and other outhouse destroyed or damaged, the losses aggregating
820,000.) Indications of the storm are re-
ported from numerous neighborhoods in th county. Alf. Darnall's tobacco barn on
Blooming Grove was blown down. At St Bethlehem, Sam Jackson's barns were blow down, as were Mrs. Hatcher's stables, killin several cows. A barn containing 20oii0
pounds of tobacco, belonging to Mr. Clark at
Pembroke, was blown down, and two bani were overturned north of Port Royal. At
Bennettstown, Ky., several miles from Lafay-
ette, the storm was very severe. The light-
ning struck and burned a barn near Sadlers-

SUBSCRIPTION. - - - 25c PER ANNUM Entered at the Postoffice at Nashville as Second Class
M attar The Uniled States Cholera Commissioner In midsummer, 1884. Asiatic cholera startle all Europe and America by a sudden and terrifi outbreak in southern France. Travel stopped;
commerce was interrupted, and great money losseB
incurred. Throughout the great valley of the
Mississippi, which is the United States, less tw ocean friuges, the keenest interest was felt in it firogre&o. Hopes at first prevailed that such en-
ightened governments as those of France, Spai and Italy were in line with modern sanitary prog-
ress, and that the epidemic would be confined to  small area. These hopes proved baseless. Upo trial the people, and the rulers especially, of
Spain and Italy proved utterly unfit for the emer-
gency. Hence in 1885, Spain and Italy were i some portions dreadfully scourged, and becam the scenes of a panic, terror and a misery unlooke for in the last quarter of the much lauded nine-
teenth century Qiving heed to the general wish of the people,
the American government determined to investi-
gate the cholera in Europe. In the autumn of
1886, Dr. Edward O. Shakespeare, of Philadel-
phia; was appointed as this most important com-
mission. The Journal of the American Med-
ical Association, October 10, 1885, says: "Th appointment reflects great credit on the govern-
ment."
Dr. Shakespeare's progress has been watched b this board with lively interest from that date t the present. In the Bulletin for December,
1886, attention was called to his suggestio as follows:
"early recognition of cholera Dr. E. O. Shakespeare, who some months ag was appointed bv the United States Governmen to go abroad and investigate the subject of cholera,
recently in a lecture before the College of Physi-
cians of Phildelphia, is reported as having mad the following statement, which every medica man, but especially every officer of health, shoul bear in mind, and be prepared upon the shortes notice to intelligently apply the test suggested,
should occasion arise. He said: 'Although th proof of the statement that the comma-bacillus i the active and efficient cause of cholera Asialica wa not entirely satisfactory to his mind, the lecture felt no hesitation in declaring that Koch had con-
ferred an inestimable boon upon the race b placing in the hands of every practitioner au in-
fallible means of diagnosis of this disease fro cholera morbus and other diseases resembling chol-
era. He expressed the opinion that a health office or physician who, in the presence of suspected cases an be, ore the prevalence of the malady as an epidemic,
should Jail lo employ this means of deciding whether o not the disease is genuine cholera, would be guilty o criminal negligence.'"
Desiring full information as to the practica details so far as the same could be simplified fo applying this test, the President sent the followin letter:
Tennessee State Board of Health,
Nashville, May 3,1887 Dr. E. O. Shakespeare,
Philadelphia. Pa Dear Sir:—By to-days mail I send you  marked copy of December Bulletin. That th greatest good may be made to follow your sugges-
tion therein alluded to, I have determined to ask
—if it be not too much—that you prepare fo publication in Bulletin, specific direction?,
brief but clear, as to the mode of procedure, ste by step, etc., in detecting the comma-bacillus; th same to be carried out by the average practitione of medicine, or health officer, in the event of  suspicious "first" case of cholera occurring in
Tennessee during the approaching season. Th great value of early differentiation of cholera Asi-
atics from cholera morbus, etc., cannot be over-es-
timated, and if the means to that end can be s simplified that an average practitioner can appl successfully the same, a great work will indee have been accomplished. Trusting that you ma consider favorably the request made, I am, sir,
with great respect, Your obedient servant,
J. D. Plunkkt.

  p. 102 (#124)                       102 STA TE BOARD OF
EALTH BULLETIN No reply was received, and as two meetings o the American Public Health Association hav transpired, nt which were gathered the Health
Officers of the continent, and other prominent san-
tar ans, and no intimation was given of his obser-
vations, and as up to now no official reports hav been published, so far as we know, the questio naturally arises in our mind: Why, if E. 0 Sliakespeare, M. D., is not a mylh, have hi obervations upon cholera, if they hud any rea value or special interest to the American public,
been so long delayed in their publication?

ease of the town and surrounding country. Fre-
quently families are found in which the well, ar not able to take care of the sick. And as usual a this Reason of the year the sequahe have bee frequent, and often serious, particularly catarrha pneumonia and bronchitis. Mumps have als been of frequent occurrence during the month;
occasional cases of whooping-cough have occurred,
one case of cerebro-spinal meningitis and one o jaundice have been reported Croupous pneu-
monia has been of infrequent occurrence. No ty-
phoid fever that I know of. A few cases of scarle fever at Decherd Oibson county—Dr. T.J. Hsppel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—For the month of March I
would report a continuation of the epidemic o measles in Trenton and vicinity, and a number o deaths occurred from pneumonia and bronchiti as the sequalse of rubeola. In Trenton ther were, as near as can be estimated, 300 cases o measles, with eight or nine deaths, directly trace-
able to the disease or its sequalre. In the last wee the disease has materially abated all over th county. During the epidemic, roseola in a Bever form made its appearance here and in other part of the county. In many cases it was mistaken b parents for rubeola, and they were undeceive only when undoubted cases of rubeola occurred i the same children. In my own practice I me with one case of uncomplicated pneumonia, an six or eight cases of myalgia. Dr. T. J. Moore, of
Bradford, reports a subsidence of the epidemic o measles with very few deaths. Dr. A. B. Clay, of
Rutherford reports a few cases of roseola, rheuma-
tism, pneumonia and neuralgia, but all easily con-
trolled; that 17 per cent of the population ha measles with no death; that the health of tha part of the county is decidedly good. Dr. W. G
Clendenning,*bf Brazil, reports a few cases of pneu-
monia among the negroes with some deaths; tha he had treated several cases of typhoid fever since
January, and that sickness is on the decline. Dr.
B D Caldwell, of Medina, reports an epidemic o roseola in a Fevere form, mistaken frequently fo measles; several cases of pneumonia and one o sporadic dysentery. From these reports, all fro different quarters of the county, it is plainly show that sickness is decreasing Milan—M. D. L. Jordan, M. D.—Measles sub-
siding for want of material Pneumonia as  sequalse followed some cases; more fatality tha usual. Except as above, health of the town an vicinity g"od Trenton—A. S. Currey, Esq.—The measles,
which were so prevalent the first of the month,
have almost entirely disappeared. Bronchia troubles, with pneumonia, followed as a sequence,

sumption and one from old age, one from pistol-
shot, and one from being crushed by a log Haideman county—Dr Jas. J. Neely, Jr., County
Health Officer, Bolivar.—For March in Boliva and vicinity there has been a steady spread o measles with no deaths so far, within the corpor-
ate limits. In connection with measles, roseol in a very severe form prevails. There have bee several cases of typhoid fever. No deaths. Asid from the epidemics of measles and roseola the tow and county are in a very healthy condition Hardin county—Dr. J. K. Barlow, County

pears pneumonia sets in, and then the fight fo life begins in earnest. In most of the cases the ex-
pectoration is enormously large. Typhoid symp-
toms frequently supervene, the bowels becom tympanitic, with a tendency to colliquative diar-
rhce. Some deaths have occurred, but taking int account the gravity of the symptoms, the percent-
age of deaths has been small. Qtiiniaand whisk are undoubtedly our best remedies. Have ha measles here for more than a year. Hope it i giving us a parting kick. Nothing further of im-

"Yoursof the 29th ult. received, and I have mad the inquiry concerning the matter referred to, an will give you the result:
"1. I saw Mr. Harsh, who wrote the letter t the Louisville Board of Health, and he says h wrote it for information ; that it had been the prac-
tice of some farmers to ship hogs as soon as an disease broke out in their stock. It seems to hav been done some year or so ago.
"2. I have made inquiry and find that there i no disease among the hogs now prevailing else-

BY DANIEL F. WEIGHT, M. D Non-Nitrogenous Bodies.—The prelimi-
nary considerations on which the practical foo question is based have unavoidably been pu forward in a very intermittent manner, an the amount of matter that could be given i one number of the Bulletin has been s small, on account of our limitations as regard space, that we fear the whole subject has as-
sumed a disjointed character not favorable t elear conceptions of the argument. We pro-
ceed, however, to the best of our ability, t give the practical conclusions for which thes theoretical papers were intended to be prelim-
inary. We find, however, that this will occup several papers, and can not be confined to th present one, as was anticipated in our las number. The subject expands before us a we go on, and we can not at present assign an limits to it Bread-stuffs.—So essential a part of huma food is bread, that the word has, by a natura metonymy, come to be used for food in gen-
eral, and when we are taught to pray for ou daily bread, we understand it as expressin our dependence on Divine bounty for all tha constitutes the sustenance of the human body We are here, however, considering speciall the food products of the various cereal grains,
and its sanitary relations. Of these the mos universally in use is wheat, and wheal brea will be selected as the typical form of farina-
ceous food. The materials of bread have bee shown to be mainly starch and gluten, o which the former represents the hydro-carbo and the latter the protoplasm. We shal mainly treat of it here as starch, reserving^ th protoplasmic principle till we treat of it a contained in animal food. The starch i largely predominant in bread, the protoplas iu meat. -
Bread differs from meat in this importan respect, that it requires a chemical chang from starch to glucose before it can be nutri-
tious, while meat is already, prior to digestion,
in a condition for nutriment, without chem-
ical change. Hence, bread, contrary to gen-
eral opinion, requires more digestion tha meat. Moreover, as it has beep shown tha the saliva is a principal agent in its transform-
ation, mastication is even more important tha in the case of animal food. Now the form i which bread is generally furnished at our to-
bies is very unfavorable to mastication; w get it hot from the oven, in which condition i will not crumble, and mastication fails alto-
gether to break up its texture; there is non of the minute subdivision which has bee shown to be necessary for its digestion. Th bread ought to be eaten about the third da after baking, never earlier than the second It should also be thoroughly baked, as  doughy condition is equally fatal to its minut subdivision. Moreover, this comminution o particles is most thoroughly maintained whe a moderate quantity of oleaginous substance i masticated with it (not in a liquid condition),
such as butter or animal fat; without this th masticated mass is liable to consolidate again But here the objection to hot bread come in again. The most contrary to all hygieni principles is the hot buttered roll of a luxur-
ious breakfast; here the bread is hardly mas-
ticated at all, but goes to the stomach as  mass of dough, while the butter, squeezed ou of it, goes down in the form of a semi-flui oil, no combination being effected at all As bread, when not used as an accompani-
ment of animal food, always means bread an butter among English speaking people, it ma be well to say a word in behalf of the thi bread and butter of the English tea-table a the most sanitary form in which the two arti-
cles can be combined. Strange to say, it is al-
most unknown on our tables. The conse-
quence is that all the conditions of preparin sanitary bread have to be considered befor we can understand what constitutes an Englis plate of bread and butter. 1. The bread mus bo well leavened ("salt rising" bread won' do; it can't be kept long enough). 2. Th joaves must be large enough not to get too dr in the time of keeping required for health.
3. It should not be eaten until the second, o preferably, the third day after baking. 4. T prepare for the table, a slice of the crust

should first be cut off with a sharp knife, an the butter spread on the exposed surface, be-
ing in winter slightly softened but not liquifie by heat. A slice so spread is then cut of about the eighth of an inch thick, and the ex-
posed surface treated as before for a secon slice, the process being continued till enoug is prepared for the meal; the slices are lai like shingles over one another on the dish, an the bread and butter is ready for the table This seems like petty trifling in a grave sani-
tary treatise, but, until I can see a plate of
English bread and butter on an American ta-
ble, I shall not be convinced that hygiene ha made its way to our breakfast and supper ta-
bles. There is no other way in which the tw great elements of food can be so adequatel prepared for perfect incorporation in the pro-
cess of mastication, and the simple dish of
"bread and butter" is put forward as a typica form for the healthy combination of amyla-
ceous and oleaginous food In the making of the bread two things hav to be provided for: 1. The inclusion in th flour of all the nutritious elements of th wheat; and, 2. The aeration of the dough An important element is lost when th wheat is ground by ordinary methods. Thi is the eerealine, an important element whic exists in the grain only immediately under th thin skin and generally goes with the bran, s that the cows really get the best part of th wheat; this is saved in the flour by an im-
proved method of grinding which takes off th skin without detaching the eerealine. Th subsequent grinding then produces a flou which contains all the nutritious principle of the wheat, including starch, glutine an eerealine. This flour has been denominate whole Jlour But flour so made is not white if any leave or ferment is used with it; the ferment de-
composes the eerealine and thereby deprive it of much of its nutritive value, at the sam time that it causes it to discolor the bread This may be avoided by changing the proces for aerating the bread Aeration is the process by which the doug is made to assume a spongy consistency throug the formation of innumerable air bubbles i its substance; the smaller and more numer-
ous these are and the more evenly disperse through its substance the more perfect is th aeration. This is generally effected by fer-
mentation, which is not, however, either th most healthy or the most economical method;
for in whatever way fermentation is brough about it consists in the decomposition of som part of the flour so as to generate carboni gas from it, so that the bubbles above de-
scribed are not really air bubbles, but ga bubbles. Now fermentation, to say the bes of it, is a wasteful process; it acta by the in-
troduction into the mass of the dough of  small quantity of a substance which is under-
going decomposition; this tendency to decom-
position is communicated to the dough itself,
and by decomposing part of it, supplies th gas which aerates the rest. But the par which is decomposed is lost for all purpose of nutrition. Nor is this loss all the objec-
tion to ferments. The substances used fo starting the process are not always in a sani-
tary condition; they are found sometimes t be undergoing the acetic instead of the alco-
holic fermentation, and then they excite  similar action in the dough mass which pro-
duces sour bread The remedy tor all this is the process fo introducing the carbonic gas from withou instead of generating it within the bread b means of a ferment. This is the metho invented in 1859 by the German physician Dr. Dauglish: The carbonic gas is generate in a strong vessel, exactly on the same princi-
ple as that on which it is prepared for sod founts, and forced through the substance o the dough by pressure from an air-pump. I has been in use ever since in large cities, bot in Europe and America, with excellent re-
sults. It not only produces a better an cheaper bread, but it is a cleanlier process,
the baker's hands not coming in contact wit the bread at all. It is moreover healthier,
for the bakers, who suffer impaired healt under the present system through inhalin the flour into their lungs. Of course this pro-
cess cannot be carried on in private families,
as it implies an extensive apparatus only fitte for large establishments; but every conside-
rable city ought to sustain a baking establish-
ment using whole flour, and working the Dau-
glish aerating apparatus, with profit, especiall if the public were duly enlightened on th system The importance of the bread question can-
not be exaggerated. Healthy bread is no only of great sanitary value itself, but as  concomitant of all other viands it assists i promoting their digestion as well as furnish-
ing a digestible and nutritious article of die in itself As we endeavored to show in th familiar instance of bread and butter, that th bread helps to digest the butter and the but-
ter the bread, so good bread in combinatio with meat, with sugar, in short with all kind of food, helps to make them digestible b promoting and maintaining that minute sub-
division and combination of heterogeneou particles which we have shown to be an essen-
tial condition of digestion But to do all this in perfection, brea should possess the following qualities:
1. It should contain all the proximat principles of the wheat.
2. It should contain nothing else but the and water.
3. It should be light, or in other word well aerated.
4. It should be not so new when eaten a to he incapable of crumbling in the process o mastication.

Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, April 24, 1888 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President Slate Board of Health:
Sir—One of the most practical steps lately ta-
ken for the prevention of the spread of epidemi diseases, is the agreement or compact entered int at Toronto, October 6th, 1886, by the International
Conference of State Boards of Health, and als adopted by the American Public Health Associa-
tion, on October 8th, 1886 The State Board of Tennessee was fully repre-
sented at these conferences, and has faithfull complied with the obligations then and there in-
curred, which can be best understood by a stud of the resolutions adopted.
"Whereas, It is necessary for the protectio and preservation of the public health that promp information should be given of the existence o cholera, yellow fever and small-pox; be it
1. Resolved, That it is the sense of the National
Conference of State Boards of Health that it i the duty of each state, provincial and local boar of health in any locality in which said disease may at any time occnr, to furnish immediatel information of the existence of such diseases t boards of health of neighboring and provincia states, and to the local board in such states a have no state board.
2. Resolved, That upon rumor or report of th existence of pestilential diseases, and positive def-
inite information thereon not being obtainabl from the proper health authorities, this conferenc recommends that the health officials of one stat shall be privileged and justified to go into anothe state for the purpose of investigating and estab-
lishing the truth or falsity of such reports.
3. Resolved, That whenever practicable, the in-
vestigations made under the preceding sectio shall be done with the co-operation of the state o local health authorities.
4. Resolved, That any case which presents symp-
toms seriously suspicions of one of the aforename diseases, shall be treated as suspicious, and re-
ported as provided for in cases announced as ac-
tual.
5. Resolved, That any case respecting which rep-
utable and experienced physicians disagree as t whether the disease is or is not pestilential, shal be reported as suspicious.
6. Resolved, That any case respecting which ef-
forts are made to conceal its existence, full histor and true nature, shall be deemed suspicious an so acted upon.
7. Resolved, That in accordance with the pro-
visions of the foregoing resolutions, the boards o health of the United States and Canada repr sented at this conference, do pledge themselves t an interchange of information as herein provided."
In pursuance with the above resolutions, the
State Board of Health of Tennessee has durin the last quarter been notified of the presence o small-pox in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine,
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinoi and Louisiana So soon as the case of small-pox occurred at
Jackson, in this state, notice was at once sent t all the state boards of health in the Union and
Dominion Sanitarians in the United States are now quite

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
uneasy about a threatened outbreak of small-pox Not without reason; for so far as prophylaxis b universal vaccination is concerned, the depend-
ence is upon a broken reed. Very few communi-
ties in America are properly guarded in this re-
spect. We must rely upon isolation and disin-
fection in each individual case to prevent its rapi spread and consequent immense damage to th neighborhood in which it may occur. Hence th vital importance that prompt and reliable inform-
ation should at once be given to local and stat health authorities, so that efficient steps may b taken to stamp out this loathesome pest As to small-pox, Tennessee should never rela extreme vigilance. Eight great lines of railwa traverse the state, with numerous branches no penetrating its remote recesses. New lines are unde way in all portions of the state, employing larg bodies of laborers, mostly from abroad. W should be prepared at any time to hear that im-
ported cases of small-pox exist in any one of ou ninety-six counties. The majority of these coun-
ties are working in harmony with the ttate boar of health, as by law required, and are ready t comply with its regulations for speedily stampin out this and all infectious diseases. It is to b much regretted that several counties yet ignor the statute on this important subject There is no excuse for this lethargy, for withi the present decade epidemics of small-pox alon have cost the authorities of only seven countie the large sum of SI41,616.91, a,s shown by item in the Bulletin, Vol. II, page 69, besides grea damage to business and life. If lull statistic could have been obtained, the aggregate woul doubtless have been more than doubled. Onl the other day Park Marshal, Esq., of Franklin,
furnished me with the cost of small-pox in Wil-
liamson county, from the official records: In 1882,
$1,882.22; in 1883, $3,824.05; total, $5,700.27 The corporation of Franklin also incurred som expenses. There were some fifty to seventy-fiv cases Contrast this experience with that of Jackson,
as reported in the Bulletin, March and Apri numbers. Here a prompt county health official,
acting according to law, at once reports to th state board and calls upon the local authoritie for means to carry out the rules and regulation of that board. The afflicted persons are wel cared for and recovered, the public is not alarmed,
the disease does not spread, and the tax-paye foots no thousands Dr. Henry B. Baker, in a recent very minut and thorough study of epidemics of diphtheria in
Michigan, demonstrates most conclusively tha the formula now adopted as an axiom by sanita-
rians for the prevention of the spread of epidemi diseases may be relied upon; to-wit: isolatio and disinfection The following additions have been made to th library since my last report:

Whereas, During the recent past prevent-
ive medicine has made marked progress in the
United States, as is shown in the fact that no only a small minority of the states are withou state boards of health, and all the cities of the
Union have well organized municipal healt boards; and,
'Whereas, The necessity now exists for a cen-
tral Bureau of Public Health, possessed of am-
ple authority and funds, which shall gathe together at short intervals of time and prop-
erly interpret the mortality and morbility sta-
tistics as may be supplied by these severa state and municipal boards, and which shal furnish reliable information regularly of epi-
demic diseases as they may prevail in foreig countries, and give timely warning of the ap-
proach to or arrival upon the shores of Amer-
ica of any epidemic diseases, and which shal especially, be charged with the duty of inves-
tigating the ultimate cause of all communica-
ble diseases, and the best means of preventin both the origin and spread of the same; there-

nessed such a one) rose in the northwest at 7
p.m., accompanied by a fierce wind which lev-
eled fences and uprooted trees. Hail one-hal inch in diameter fell thickly for ten minutes,
doing damage to fruit and vegetation. Th thunder and lightning were terrific; the light-
ning (diffuse) was almost incessant for mor than an hour, and was accompanied by shar and deafening peals of thunder The thunderstorm of the night of the 22 was very severe in many localities, especiall in the middle and western divisions, as th following reports indicate:
Camden, April 23.—A most terrific hai storm struck this place last night at 11.40 The wind blew fiercely and the sky seemed on solid sheet of lightning, accompanied with  constant roar of thunder. The storm laste about seven minutes. Vegetation was greatl cut up by the hail. The wind blew down  great deal of fencing, but no serious damag was done in town except to the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church and Masonic Hall. Thi house is so badly damaged that it is thought i will have to be taken to pieces and rebuilt Waverly, April 23.—A severe rain an hailstorm visited this place Sunday night,
about 9.30 o'clock. No particular damage wa done. The hail was so heavy as to beat som of the leaves from the trees, and perforate them like shot from a gun. During the stor the people in this section were treated t something that is seldom seen in the south—
that is, globular lightning Lynnville, April 23—A very heavy rai fell last night about midnight. The wind fo a short time blew furiously. Quite a hailstor prevailed a few miles northeast. Rain was be-
ginning to be needed. No damages have bee reported Lebanon, April 23.—During the magnifi-
cent thunder storm last night the dwellin house of Attorney General Lilliard Thomp-
son, occupied by Mrs. Armstrong and family,
on the corner of High and Cedar streets, wa struck by lightning. None of the occupant were hurt, save by slight shock and fright The house had a quantity of shingles torn fro the roof. The shower accompanying th storm was much needed by the farmers The observer at Ashwood says: The rain o the night of the 22d was very severe N. and
N.W. of station some eight or ten miles dis-

Matter-
Look Out Simultaneously though "a long ways apart,"
there developed in Memphis upon May 19,
two foci of small-pox infection, and fro these foci there have occurred already nin other cases of small-pox, making a total o eleven up to this writing. There is no evi-
dence to show that the first cases had a com-
mon origin or were in any remote way con-
nected one with the other, but on the con-
trary. A condition of things which may an day be duplicated in any railroad or rive town in Tennessee. The simple statement o fact as given should be enough to arrest th attention of every practitioner of medicine i the State and cause him to urge, where it ha not successfully been done before, the imme-
diate vaccination of each member of eac family or individual whose medical adviser h may be. For in vaccination lies our greates protection. But especially should the an-
nouncement stimulate to the greatest vigi-
lance every health officer, municipal an county, so that at the earliest possible mo-
ment after the appearance of this deadly an loathsome disease within his jurisdiction h may enforce rigid isolation and disinfection,
together with the other "rules and regula-
tions" of this board prescribed for the restric-
tion and prevention of small-pox. The tid of immigration which, during the last two o three years, has so decidedly set in toward
Tennessee, has increased many fold the trave of strangers upon all the net work of railroad which now ramify the different sections of th state, and has, as a consequence, greatly in-
creased the danger to the public health o our commonwealth by reason of the more fre-
quent importation into our midst of infectiou and contagious diseases, at the head of whic at this time we may place small-pox. Henc the responsibility and duty of the health of-
ficer has been and is being rapidly increase in many directions and ways, and it behoove him to fully recognize the fact and to act ac-
cordingly.

eases prevailed in tliis county during May: Bil-

thier than usual for this season of the year Bradley county—Dr. L. V. Brown, County
Health Officer, Cleveland.—During the month
"f May we had a few cases of dysentery reported There are a number of children who have suffere more or less with diarrhoea and intestinal irrita-
tion. Some two or three well marked cases o cholera-niorbus have been observed Campbell county —Dr. J. H. Agee, County

spection—secure abatement of every character o nuisances promptly, and hence the sanitary con-
dition of the county is about all that can be de-
sired Nashville—Dr. Chas. Mitchell,City Health Officer An especially low death record for month of May The prevailing diseases for the month wer diarrheal diseases and typhoid and malaria fevers. A few scattering cases of scarlet feve and measles were reported during the month, wit one death from each. There was some excite-
ment and alarm created in East Nashville durin the latter part of the month by a rumor that  malignant type of ''spotted fever" or cerebr spinal meningitis, had broken out in that sectio of the city. As is usual in such cases, the rumor were very much exagerated. There were fou cases (three of them fatal) all told, and thes were confined to two families of a tubercula diathesis. I made a careful inspection of th premises and neighborhood in person, and foun the premises of every one in an excellent sanitar condition The first case appeared about May 20,
and the last one about rive days after. If a epidemic was threatening we certainly woul have had other cases ere this. I am therefore in-
clined to give the individual diathesis and sus-
ceptibility special significance in looking for  solution to the problem Decatur county—Dr. J. F. Aydelott, County

siding. The same may be said of mumps, whic have been so prevalent. Aftej- long suffering, a old man died a day or so ago with jaundice,
which closed out the most remarkable epidemi of that disease ever known in this county. Dur-
ing the last few days there have been a few mil cases of dysentery in the county, which woul now seem to be the coming disease Gibson county—Dr. T. .1. Happel, County Health

mediately moved to the small-pox hospital, an the houses, with the furnilure, thoroughly disin-
fected with the bi-chloride solution, one part t one thousand of water, as recommended by the
Louisiana Board of Health, and then the fume of sulphur. As these two cases had existed fo nearly a week, I could hardly expect to stam out the disease immediately, as the infection hu evidently gotten out before we discovered th cases. However, every precaution was imme-
diately taken to prevent further spread, and  public vaccinator was put to work as soon as  supply of fresh vaccine could be obtained. Thi vaccinator, Dr. S. P. Greene, is still at work On June 3d two cases were discovered in th neighborhood of the Greenlaw-street cases, both o which were sent to the hospital.

velop yet, but at this time there is no case in th city and none in the county that I know of out-
side of the hospital. I do not anticipate any se-
rious spread, and will keep you informed.

"July, August, and September are the wors months, and the " second year " the dreaded per-
iod of the child's life. As preventative measures,
are recommended: 1. The nursing of the chil over the second summer, when this can lie prop-
erly done, if her milk agrees with the child, an the mother is not exhausted. '2. The wearing of
I thin flannel shirt by the child all through th summer. It should be thin, and in hot weathe toy thin. 3. Feeding only milk or other foo known to be fresh,and absolutely pure. 4. When-
ever possible, babies should spend the summe months in the country. If the above precaution could always be carried out, summer complain would be almost unknown. With care, the dis-
ease can be greatly diminished. At all events,
(luring the summer months, give the child pur water to drink at frequent intervals, for it need water to supply that lost by the perspiration Bathe it in cool or tepid water twice a day. Kee it in the ojien air as much as possible and wher llie air is pure. Don't permit it to have any sour,
unripe, over-ripe, or half decayed fruits. Eve ripe fruit may cause injury if the child be allowe to indulge at will.
A very frequent cause of the early death o y.iiinj! children is improper feeiiing. The natura food for babies is tbe breast milk of its ow mother, next that of a wet nurse; lastly, unskim-
med cow's milk or goat's milk; the latter is ver nourishing and easily digested. For young babie remember that milk and milk only should be use as food. They need no gruel, butter, honey o castor oil ; these things are all worse than useless
—they are dangerous. Too much care cannot b exercised to secure pure milk It is now believe that milk derived from a number of cows is bette than that from one cow. If from one cow, car should be taken not to get it from a cow whic has been milking too long, since milk frequentl deteriorates from this cause; also, when the mil disagrees with the child, it will be well to chang the cow. As soon as the milk is received, i should be placed on the stove and brought to  boil, then placed in the coolest place—on ice or i the well. The vessel in which the milk is kep should daily be scalded out with boiling wate and cleaned with soap, being kept perfectly pur and sweet. Earthen or glass or stone-ware vessel are preferable to tin ones for keeping milk in Never gii'e a baby sour or musty milk; it must alway be sweet and pure, and freshly prepared eac time; if sour, throw it away and get some fresh;
it cannot be safely sweetened. When fed to th child, the milk should be diluted with one fourt or less water, and a little sugar added ; but befor you add water, be sure that the milkman has no previously added it. If the undiluted mil agrees with the child, use it. Use "condense milk " if the fresh cannot be had pure. Unde six months, children can be stuffed with, but no nourished by, corn, flour, arrowroot, baked Hou and all other kinds of starchy foods. These ar of no value at all to children under six months,
and they may be and often are starved to deat on these things
WheTe the child has cut its front teeth, it shoul have some light food, as bread, baked flour o milk biscuits added to its milk. Once .a day, i may have meat, broth or beef tea, with bread o biscuits soaked in it—or the yolk of an egg lightl boiled. When ii is a year and a half old, it ma have some fine chopped meat, but milk shoul still be its principal food. At two years, it ma ent of corn meal mush, rolled wheat, oat grits,
etc., but such food as solid meat and potatoes,
fat pork and (isli. which form the food of adults,
should on no account be given to babies. Do no give any of the patented baby foods sold at th stores, unless on Me adtice of your family physician Creeping and crawling children must not be per-
mitted to pick up unwholesome food The nursing bottle needs special attention. I should be oval, with no corners or rough place in which the milk may lodge and become sour.
A plain black rubber nipple to slip over the mout of the bottle is the best pattern. Never use th elaborate and complex nipples with glass an rubber lubes attached, because they cannot b readily cleansed ; and they also invite in the bab the habit of sleeping with the nipple in the mouth,
a thing which should never happen. Both bottl and nipple should be thoroughly cleansed in boil-
ing water after each using, and then kept in col water to which a little baking soda has bee added, until used again.—[Pennsylvania State Boar of Health..]

EEPOBT IFOIR, IMTA "Y, 1888 The meteorological conditions for Ma show but few departures from the normal o the past six years. The principal feature wa the period of low temperature about the 15th.
culminating in a heavy frost in most parts o the State. There were no very high winds,
and only one severe electric storm, which wa rather local in its character, except as to th rain accompanying it. The percentage o cloudiness was above the normal The mean temperature was 65°.7, ver nearly the normal for the past six years. Th highest local mean was 70°.2, recorded at
Bolivar, and the lowest 603.3, recorded at
Fostoria. The highest temperature was 90°.0,
recorded on the 20th, and was the lowest
May maximum recorded during the past si years, except in 1884, when it was the same,
the highest being 04°.() in 1885. The lowest,
temperature was 30°.0, recorded on the 15th,
and was the lowest by three degrees durin the period named, and the same as the Apri minimum. The days on which the maximu temperature was recorded were the 11th, 2o'th,
27th and 28th. The minimum temperatur was recorded on the 15th, generally in th eastern and middle divisions, and on the 1st,
2d and 14th in the western division, and at  few stations in the middle division. Th daily ranges of temperature were very nearl the normal The mean precipitation was 3.72 inches,
slightly below the May mean for the past si years, and the least during that period, excep in 1884 and 1887. Of this amount, the east-
ern division received an average of nearl five and a half inches, the middle division  little more than three inches, and the wester division about two and a half inches. Th rains during the month were at most of th stations frequent, but generally light, th heaviest fall being reported at Chattanoog on the .'50th, measuring 2.45 inches; the nex heaviest was 1.70 inch, reported at lliddle-
ton on the 24th, 1.68 inch at Parksvill on the 31st, and 1.G5 inch at Fayettcville o the 18th. The rain of the 24th at Trento was perhaps the heaviest in the state durin the month. 1.45 inch falling in one hour There were a few other stations where mor than an inch of rain in twenty-four consecu-
tive hours was reported. The frequency o the rains in various parUs of the state can b imagined from the fact that only two day during the month were reported as withou measurable rainfall at any of the stations,
and on one of these a trace or sprinkle wa recorded. These days were the 26th and 27th The greatest monthly rainfall was 8.00 inche reported at Newport, and the least, 1.90 inc at Milan. Hail fell at a few stations. Dew were reported at various stations on eightee days, and frosts on four days, the last, on the
15th, being a killing frost at many stations,
especially in the eastern and middle divisions The percentage of verifications of weathe and temperature predictions sent daily fro the Signal Office at Washington, to the various
.stations in the state, were for the state:

Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, July 3, 1888 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health:
Sir—In my last report I called special attentio to the indifference pervading the medical profes-
sion and the general public in regard to the timel prevention oi sniall-pox. From extensive trave and conversation in all portions of Tennessee, th conclusion is evident that a large majority of ou people are not protected against liability to thi loathsome disease so far as the recognized prophy-
lactic of a hundred years experience is concerned In the last four years, one of the principal dru houses which makes a specialty of keeping th best vaccine virus, reports sales amounting to si hundred dollars. Perhaps this represents half th entire amount used in Tennessee during the pas four years When the condition of the large African popu-
lation, crowded into our cities and towns is take into consideration, it is evident that just now, de-
pendence upon vaccination is leaning upon  broken reed Prompt isolation and absolute disinfection mus be our first reliance; health officers and physi-
cians must be wide awake. Upon the County
Courts rests a very heavy responsibility. Thes bodies have the power and the means for preven-
tive measures. By prompt action thousands upo thousands of dollars may be saved, and terrorizin alarms prevented The notification of the existence of small-po in adjoining and distant states caused the Execu-
tive Committee to order a large edition of the
June Bulletin, and of the pamphlet giving in-
structions for the management of small-pox, shoul it appear in any neighborhood. These document have been circulated with systematic care in ever nook and corner of the State, and thus all con-
cerned put upon their guard Dr. G. B. Thornton, President of the Memphis
Board of Health, has furnished under date of
July 1st the following full statement, respectin the occurrance of small-pox in that city from it first appearance on May 19th:

Matter The Record Made Three years ago the State Board of Healt determined to take charge of the State Weather
Service, then abandoned by the Bureau of
Agriculture, Statistics and Mines, and at th same time began the issue of the monthly
BuXLKTIN, which now enters upon its fourt volume The connection of climatology with diseas is rapidly becoming one of the three or fou advance movements which mark the presen time as an epoch in the history of medicine The Board, without dissent, judged that th meteorological records of Tennessee shoul be continued, preserved, and made known t the public at large The law enacted early in 1885. creating
County Boards of Health, gave the State
Board an official observer and reporter in eac of the ninety-six counties covering its area Were this law fully carried out a large amoun of valuable information respecting the preva-
lence of disease would be furnished in th monthly statements of the county health offi-
cers. Notwithstanding the meagre aid ex-
tended by the county courts to their healt officers, a large number of these have wit much public spirit entered zealously into th views of the State Board, and have fro month to month sent in valuable information The columns under the head, "Health in
Tennessee,' show in detail who have been th workers. It was hoped that long ere this ev-
ery town in Tennessee of two thousand inhab-
itants would have established a local board o health, through which exact mortality statis-
tics could be obtained. This hope has bee disappointed. Even large, thriving and grow-
ing communities, as Jackson, Union City,
Murfreesboro, Huntingdon, Brownsville, Day-
ton, South Pittsburg, Pulaski, Cleveland,
Athens, Bristol, not to name a number o others, exhibit an inexcusable lethargy on thi subject Throughout Europe and in most of th states comprising the American union, th most conclusive evidence received concernin salubrity is the death rate. Vague state-
ments concerning the general health go fo nothing; in fact, rather make against thos who give them out. The violent presump-
tion is that towns, cities and states which d not make and publish full records of ever fact connected with the movement of popu-
lation are afraid to do so. Tennessee ha lost, is now losing, and will continue to los by not maintaining a complete system of regis-
tration of marriages, births and deaths Thankful for the co-operation thus far re-
ceived, and sure of increased usefulnes ahead, the Bulletin enters upon its new vol-
ume by such increase of its pages as will ena-
ble it more fully than ever to fulfill its func-
tion of an official scientific record.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Yellow Fever Outlook Late in the autumn of 1886 an epidemic oc-
curred at Biloxi, Miss., which attracte great attention from the public at large as wel as from the medical profession. After n little racket it was finally decided with grea unanimity to be yellow fever This was a warning note, clearly sounded, t the people of Florida, Mississippi and Geor-
gia, reminding them significantly of the event studding the annals of 1873, 1878 and 1879 It is strange that thus warned the example o their neighbors in Louisiana, Alabama and
South Carolina was not followed and goo working state boards of health established,
with powers and means to keep wide awak and to assist and advise with local boards Many wise citizens of Florida did make a effort to awaken a lethargic legislature, but t no purpose At' Key West, Florida, on May 21, 1887,  case of yellow fever was reported, and up to
June 10, twenty-two cases and eight deaths The United States government, having grea interests there, used all means to stamp it out Yet, up to September 14, 282 cases and sixty-
two deaths were reported. A few cases onl afterwards; epidemic over At Tampa, on the Gulf coast of Florida, ou
October 7, twenty cases and four deaths fro yellow fever were reported and a panic in th city. To October 21 were reported 150 case and twenty-five deaths. To November 23, i all approximately, 380 cases and seventy-on deaths. Very little alter this, though ne cases were reported as late as the first week in
December. By December 23 the quarantin was raised and refugees allowed to return;  few scattering cases, mild in character, stil remaining Surely the people and public authorities of
Florida, a state of magnificent resources, rap-
idly growing in wealth and fame, ought t have waked up after these events The Florida Health Protective Associatio announces under the date of January 18,
1888, that no yellow fever exists in Florida a present An inspection at Micanopy, Plant City and
Bartow, in April, 1888, proved the recent ex-
istence of yellow fever there and that severa other points in the southern and western por-
tions of the state are to be looked upon as sus-
picious It was officially recognized that yellow feve had reappeared at Plant City on June 22, an at Tampa in July On July 19, the governor of Florida mad application to the secretary of the treasur for aid to the local health authorities in sup-
pressing the disease Above reports are taken from "Weekly
Abstract of Sanitary Reports," published b the United States Marine Hospital Service Siuce August 10 the telegraphic columns o the daily papers throughout the Union hav made Jacksonville famous for its yellow feve explosion, and now the whole world know how Florida with its long-extended ocean an gulf coasts has become permeated with th seeds of a pestilence which for virulence an panic heads the list We need not be surprised that thousand are flying from the Land of Flowers with it semi-tropical climate: and that great uneasi-
ness prevails in all the states adjoining or nea to Florida. In all that extensive region thi generation will not forget the records an scenes of 1878. A reproach it is upon our
Christian civililization that such uneasines should prevail. With state boards and loca boards as efficiently established as in Michi-
gan and Illinois, this and all epidemics woul be met with calm courage and humane care o all the afflicted As to what may happen this next fe months, prophecy is vain. So much depend upon weather, local cleanliness or dirt, an the careful watching of those coming from in-
fected districts Under favoring weather and filth this muc feared scourge has prevailed as far north a the New England states, and upon mountain of considerable elevation As to time we must remember that the epi-
demic of 1873, which cost Memphis 1,244 lives,
commenced September 14th and ended No-
vember 9th. The far famed one of 1878 be-
ginning probably July 11, reached to th close of November. These two great epidem-
ics reached far and wide and have made  mark in history, Although a decade ha elapsed, such has been the lethargy of peopl and officials as to make us fear lest the presen year should witness a repetition of panic ter-
rors and visionary precautions.

One simple but most efficacious sanitar measure is entirely neglected with rare excep-
tions throughout southland—namely, surfac scavengering. Streets, alleys, private premi-
ses should by the labor of men with carts b kept continually and perfectly clean from al garbage and other waste stuff. In this climat it is wonderful how much contamination w inhale from an atmosphere befouled by de-
caying animal and vegetable substances Rawlinson, the distinguished oriental traveler,
dwells upon the pollution of the surface soi as a principal cause of the exceedingly fata pestilences which so frequently devastate
Asiatic countries Privies, cess pools and other store houses o filth should by no means be stirred up at thi season. For these disinfectants should b freely used until next winter, when the should be thoroughly emptied and cleaned In the above two paragraphs a huge amoun of good sanitary work is mapped out for al parts of Tennessee, which should be done al the time, regardless of epidemic scares, an which repay many times the cost in diminish-
ing damage and death from ordinary and al-
ways prevalent disease. Every city and vil-
lage in the state should go to work now whil waked up by the sufferings of a sister state When once cleaned up the comfort and sens of decency and improved condition of healt thence resulting will be apt to continue th work Small-Fox During the years 1882-1883-1884 in differen portions of the state there were outbreaks o small-pox, costing the people large amount of money. At various times in 1885,1886 and
1887, the State Board of Health has pointedl called the attention of officials and the publi to make provision against the return of thi loathesome pestilence by the protection of in-
dividuals through vaccination, urging tha it is far better to use this precaution quietl and effectually when there is no panic alarm As usual, however, too little attention wa paid to this advice In various parts of the Union, far and wide,
during the present year, small-pox showin itself has given clear premonition of a grea outbreak next winter. Our own state ha been visited just enough to take timely warn-
ing On May 19th two different foci of this dis-
ease were discovered among the negro popula-
tion in Memphis, most probably introduce by river navigation from St. Louis. The cit health authorities at once took the necessar steps for stamping out the pest. To August
1st, total cases, 31; deaths, 4 In Obion county, some three miles north of
Union City, the disease was introduced by  negro from Memphis, from whom four whit persons contracted it. One death—the negro
—July 3d. No spread. The local authori-
ties carried out the regulations of this boar with admirable promptness On July 3d a real nest of this disease wa detected in a negro family near the souther limit of the city of Nashville. So far ther have been sixteen cases and one death. O the 5th the president of this board was re-
quested to attend a meeting of the city au-
thorities, when action was to be taken in th premises, and invited to address the council He said he had always been of the opinio that a small fire was easier to put out than  large one. He thought a liberal expenditur by the city at this time would save, perhaps,
ten times as great a one hereafter. He spok of the malignancy of the small-pox in man parts of the country and .the general appre-
hension among health officials throughout th continent of a worse epidemic than had bee experienced for many years The council promptly voted the sum of
$5,000.00 On this occasion it was ascertained tha several persons had gone on the mornin train of the 4th from Nashville to Christiana,
in Rutherford county. This fact was imme-
diately communicated to the health officer o that county, by whom the proper steps wer at once taken for care and isolation. Thre cases occurred, but no spread. The railroa coach was promptly disinfected On July 7th the president of the Nashville,
Chattanooga & St. Louis railroad was notifie by the mayor of Wartrace that quarantin would be established owing to many negr residents there working in Nashville. By di-
rection of the executive committee the secre-
tary visited Wartrace at once, got an exact

list of said laborers and communicated it t the proper officials, who thereupon stoppe them fronj visiting Wartrace This recent outbreak proves that promp precaution.s will prevent both spread of an scare from disease. It is indifference and care-
lessness at the start which permits an infect-
ious plague to get fairly under way, followe by panics such as are a blot upon our presen civilization Voice of Experience The following extract from a communica-
tion which we find in the New Orleans Times-
Democrat of the 15th inst., written by Dr Joseph Holt, recently president of the Louis-
iana State Board of Health, contains so muc good practical sense and at this time so per-
tinent, we give it place in this issue of the
Bulletin It is specifically addressed to the afflicte communities of Florida, but possesses a spe-
cial value to every locality where yellow feve may develop In the first place, to tell the whole truth
"even if the heavens fall," and to do i promptly; in the second place, to act in regar to suspicious cases as if real, using all pre-
cautionary measures to prevent others of mor positive kind; immediately to isolate the prem-
ises of the case in question, preventing abso-
lutely all coming and going, except as author-
ized; and prohibiting general attendance a such funerals. Prevent all noises and the cre-
ation of any fumes or odors that may affec prejudicially the patient. Earnestly advis to keep away all "distinguished physicians,"
both in behalf of the patient and the public,
and to call in some plain, common-sense doc-
tor or old woman, who has seen yellow feve and knows something about that most treach-
erous and peculiar of all diseases. Silentl and quietly mop the floors and treat ever available surface in the house, furniture in-
cluded, with the solution of the bichloride o mercury, one part to about one-thousandth o water This solution is prepared by taking si ounces each of the bichloride of mercury an muriate of ammonia, rubbing together well i a mortar, dissolving in a gallon of hot wate and adding to forty gallons of water. Let th mopping of floors include the siek room Have just outside this door a wooden tub con-
taining a few gallons of the solution, colore by the addition of a little blueing (to preven any possible error in mistaking it for drinkin water, for there is no danger in the solutio except if swallowed), and see to it that ever article of clothing or bedding taken from thi room is at once saturated with the solution i this tub. Wet the surface of every hall,
stairway and room, including carpets, mat and furniture, with the solution, using mop and fine spray watering pots. Wet in lik manner the surface of the surrounding yard,
sidewalk and the street It. is well to treat neighboring premises, a least to the extent of wetting floors and yards In the event of an epidemic prevailing, thi treatment should include every house in town In the case of a death, immediately wrap th corpse in a sheet saturated with the mercuri solution of a strength 1 to 300 When the disease manifests a disposition t spread, let every man, woman and child in th entire town put on clothing that has bee dipped in the milder solution as first describe and then dried. If the colors should run o the clothing be a little stained, as may possi-
occur, what does that signify in such a terri-
ble emergency?
Urge the people of Jacksonville and of al invaded places to use the bichloride solutio as lavishly as rainwater in regard to its gen-
eral and thorough distribution. Let them or-
der it by the 500 or 1.000 pounds. There i positively no danger from the solution, excep when swallowed. As soon as it can be don without injury to the sick, let every room b treated with the sulphur fumigation When the sulphurous fumigation is use after the wetting of surfaces with the mercu-
ric solution, "the sulphurous gas" does not
"unite with the murcuric salt, forming a com-
pound which impairs the germidical powers o both," as declared by Assistant Surgeon J. J Kinyoun, of the United States Marine Hospi-
tal Service, in his recent report on the Louis-
iana Quarantine That officer was sent here as an expert, an has made a positive statement in regard to  point in chemistry without having taken th trouble to try the experiment When sulphurous acid gas, or liquid, o sulphuric acid is added to a solution of th bichloride of mercury there is absolutely n chemical interchange, but the solution re-
mains perfectly clear. A drop or two of th solution of the iodide of potash will revea the mercuric element by an abundant precip-
itation.
I correct this error because of its practica importance All the methods of the Lousiana Board of
Health in such a case of that of Jacksonvill are commendable because they are easily un-
derstood, are simple of application, are thor-
oughly indorsed by science and experience,
are gentle, humane and economical, and fi-
nally, offer the only substantial hope there i in such a case.

The above table is extracted from Dr. Ed-
ward Smith's highly scientific work on
"Foods/' as it seems to have been made ou with much care. It should be stated, how-
ever, that other analysts have given result considerably at variance with these,* espe-
cially as regards the percentage of protoplasti substances, such as glutine, albumen, cereal-
ine,etc., all which are included in the secon column. This is not surprising when it i noticed that different samples of wheat hav given results so widely apart that one speci-
men has given over double the percentage o another, placing the former as a maximu and the latter very nearly as a minimum—
though the latter must have been derive from a very inferior grade of wheat As these papers are prepared for practica rather than for scientific readers, we wil meDtion a test which good housewives some-
times apply in selecting flour, namely, by tak-
ing a little in the hand and squeezing it forci-
bly, when good flour, will retain the shape s given on opening the hand, but inferior flou immediately falls to powder again ; this cohe-
siveness depends upon the quantity of glutin in the specimen Now, in comparing the bread stuffs, glutin and the other nitrogenous principles will ap-
pear the most important of their constituent we shall have to treat of. It is true that, a we stated in our last paper, the amount o these principles in the bread stuffs is not s great as to make them important factors in th formation of tissue, especially when accom-
*M. Payen (Preow d> Ckimir, IndiutrieBe), gives the re-
sult ot five analyses of wheat samples, in which th percentage of starch and nitrogenized matter is state as follows:
Starch. Nitrogen Hard Wheat of Venezuela 58.12 22.74

"Taganrog, Russia 6i.S0 20 00
Medium Hard of Brie. France 63.65 16.25

The last of these specimens can hardly have bee sound wheat. Generally, hard and Bonthern grow wheats contain more nitrogenzed matter than soft an northern.
paued by animal food, but they have a mos important office to perform in promoting th efficiency of the starch itself; for it is in virtu of the fermentation that it undergoes withi the body that starch can be serviceable in an of the ways described in our last paper, an that fermentation can not be brought abou without the presence of some nitrogenous sub-
stance which is itself decomposed in excitin the process. Hence a few words may be her presented by way of somewhat enlargin the popular conception of the purposes sub-
served by fermentation in the body As generally understood, fermentation ma be described as a decomposition of organi matter attended by heat; the decompose matter being generally a carbohydrate and th decomposition being excited by the presenc of another organic substance containing nitro-
gen. But (and this is the point to which at-
tention is now specially called) fermentatio is accoinpained by another phenomenon, th development of new and living organic beings:
thus in that form of the process by whic starch or sugar is transformed into alcohol,  microscopic cryptogram, the torvla cerevisii,
or yeast plant, is produced; again, when th grain of barley is fermented so as to produc malt, the organic product is simply the newl vegetating barley itself, a vegetation which i cut short and its forces stored up as it were i the process of drying These processes are among the most interest-
ing in chemistry and physiology, but we mus resist the temptation to dwell upon them, th leading principle insisted upon being that, i the process of fermentation, organic substanc is destroyed as an essential prerequisite fo producing new organisms. To produce th starch, when it was first originated, from car-
bonic acid and water, force was involve usually in the form of heat and light; when,
on the other hand, that combination is dis-
solved, or in chemical language decompose and seperated into its original constitutents o carbonic acid and water, the original forces

are liberated or evolved and again make thei appearance in the form of heat, but not o heat alone. They are partly made availabl for the production of new organisms Outside of the body these appear in suc forms as have already been alluded to as th yeast plant or the newly germinating barley—
but wnen consumed as food, these are not th products. Then the normal processes of the
Dody, those of virilization, assimilation, secre-
tion, etc., etc., in short, the functions of ani-
mal life are excited by the same forces as out-
side of the body would simply produce th torula cerevisii. Hence, to express the foo problem as compendiously as possible, the pro-
toplasmic elements furnish the material, th carbohydrates, the forces which organize it Of course, from- this principle it follow that the less fermentation has taken place i the food before it is eaten, the more is left t occur after eating, and the more force become available for the stimulation of the vital pro-
cesses Now, here, I am going to be met with an ob-
jection. There are diseases of digestion—
these accompanied with belching, sour stomach,
etc.,—which are attributed to food fermentin internally, and it is inferred that food ough not to ferment after being swallowed. Th answer to this is, that the products of fermen-
tation are in such case the same as thos which result outside of the body; these vita principles which ought to be stimulated by i fail to act in consequence of some depresse condition in the general system, some low con-
dition of vitality dependent upon the impaire nervous action; the condition of the body ap-
proximates that of a corpse,and the fermenta-
tion acts as if in a dead rather than a livin body. We are concerned not with such case but with alimentation during health. There i no food which does not ferment; so that to at-
tempt withholding materials of fermentatio would be to withhold food altogether. It i not excessive fermentation that is in faul there, but simply that fermentation fails t produee such effects as arc proper to livin bodies It is mainly, then, through their power o exciting and maintaining fermentation, tha the bread stuffs are efficient in the body a articles of food, and the carbohydrates furnis the materials for that process and the proto-
plasmic principels supply the forces which se it in action ; the most energetic of these seem to be the cerealine.
I know of no analysis which determines th presence of this important principle in othe grains besides wheat, nor in that quantitatively So that we can only compare the relativ value of grains as producers of protoplasmi principles by observing their relative quantit of nitrogenous material Moreover, as the chemical constitution o starch and wood fibre is identical, and as th latter is not mentioned in any of the analyses
I have consulted, I infer that it is included i the starch estimate, which is unfortunate a.<
wood fibre or lignine is (at least under ordi-
nary methods of preparation) entirely innu-
tritious. We have to assume, therefore, tha its prevalence in the different grains is nearl the same, and to infer that the third colum of our table represents the presence of carbo-
hydrate nutriments relatively if not abso-
lutely. We may safely assume then that th comparative quantity of starch and nitrogen-
ous principles give us a fair estimate of the nu-
tritive value of grain, the latter representin its capacity for supporting bodily strength Maize or Indian Corn—For its abundan production and its very general use in thi country, demands ourattention next to wheat In comparing its chemical constitution wit that of wheat, as represented on our table, w find the only important difference to appear i the item of fat or oleaginous matter, of whic it contains eight times as much as wheat; th table, however, takes no account of the indi-
gestible woody fibre which in both estimates i included in the starch, and which both dimin-
ishes its nutritive value and acts as an irritan on the intestinal canal. The influence of thi however is much diminished by the carefu sifting to which every skillful housekeepe subjects her corn-meal before she makes i into bread Owing probaly to this characteristic, corn-
bread requires more thorough cooking tha that made of wheat, and this again necessitate its being baked, not in loaves but in thi cakes, and the thinner the better; the hoe-
cake of the negro cabin is the model for corn-
bread when made of corn-meal alone. Bu the most palatable and, as we believe, th most digestible preparation, is made by th admixture of some wheat-flour and eggs, con-
stituting the egg bread of the Southern table The larger predominance of oil renders maiz more heating than wheat-flour, as is wel known where it is used for horse feed, thi quality making it important to use larger pro-
portions of long feed, such as hay and fodder,
than is necessary further North, where oat take the place of maize in the stables. Fo this reason there is little doubt that the uni-
versal consumption of corn-bread and baco as country fare throughout the South contrib-
utes fully as much as climatic peculiarities t the prevalence of bilious fevers in those lati-
tudes Oats.—The value of oats as food for men in
England has been well known since the day of Dr. Samuel Johnson, from its having give occasion for a signal defeat of the great lexi-
cographer in conversational repartee. Indee the Doctor's defeat has been prolonged dow to the present day by the very general adoptio of oat-meal wherever the English language i spoken, as a specially healthy source of nutri-
ment for man as well as beast. The breakfas of oat meal and boiled milk is an instituto now very widely sanctioned both on sanitar and gastronomic principles over a very wide

extent of the earth's surface—and deservedl so.
A reference to our table will show that th chief characteristic of oats as compared wit wheat and maize consists in the larger propor-
tion of nitrogenous or protoplasmic elements,
indicating a greater power of supplying plasti materials apart from animal food; in this re-
spect oats surpass all other cereals. In regar to the carbohydrates, there is less starch tha in the other two, but the defect is partly mad up by a greater percentage of sugar in whic as well as in protoplasmic principles it sur-
passes all other cereals; and this feature prob-
ably accounts partly for its acting so kindly o the digestive organs of children which un-
doutedly demand more sugar than those o adults Oats resemble maize in ^regard to bot containing more woody fibre than other ce-
reals, which can only be made digestible by th application of greater heat in cooking. Henc the oat-cake of the Scotch, like the hoe-cak of the Southern negro, is thin, giving thereb greater access of heat to its interior, and thi suggests an important hint to the Souther housekeeper who, when she makes a mess o oat-meal porridge for breakfast, does not boil i nearly as long as her Scottish sister; it ough to be%reduced nearly to a jelly before served Barley—Need not be here considered a an an article of food, since neither in thi country nor in Europe is it cultivated for tha purpose; its only destination in either hemis-
phere is to be consigned to the brewers in th form of malt as a step to the production o beer, porter, ale, whiskey and the other mem-
bers of Sir John Barleycorn's family Rye—Has been disregarded also in view o its very rare use as human food in this country Rice and Potatoks—Are there also.thoug the latter is not a cereal, for the purpose o showing their great defect in all nutritive ele-
ments except starch—a characteristic suffi-
cient in itself to account for the national de-
generation, resulting wherever they are use as the exclusive nutriment of the people, th potato for instance in Ireland, the rice in
Hindostan.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Health Officer, Pomona.—Diarrho?a, cholera in-
fantum and malaria cover the lint of diseases i this county for the month of July Davidson courtly—-Dr. W. C. Cook, County
Health Officer, Nashville.—The general health o the county has been quite good; an occasiona case of scarlet fever being reported. During th latter part of June an outbreak of small pox oc-
curred in the city of Nashville, which, however,
waS not reported to the city health departmen till July 3. There were two centres of infection i opposite suburbs of the city and great apprehensio was felt for a time that the disease might becom widespread. As soon as the disease was reporte to the county health officer, the county board wa convened and we immediately took steps to sen all exposed and afflicted persons to the small-po hospital. In a single day and half a night w purchased all household and kitchen furniture,
secured a resident physician, hired a matron, coo snd all needed servants—had every arrange-
ment made to fully equip the hospital and ha all the patients and suspects to the number o sixteen safely removed and lodged therein a comfortably as their misfortune would allow We received into the institution during July, 27
persons, all colored. Of these there were adults,
13; minors, 14; males, 16; females, 11. Cases o small-pox, 16; suspects, 11. Died, 1 ; discharged,
10; on hand August 1, 16. The authority grant-
ed the county boards of health, under act of 1885,
enabled us to at once proceed to grapple with thi loathsome and insidious pest with a promptnes and effectiveness unparalled in the history of th disease in this state, and demonstrated the grea wisdom displayed in the passage of the law. Th indications are that the contagion has now bee confined within the hospital and that we may con-
sider the community freed from its ravages unles imported from other points Nashville— Dr. Chas. Mitchell,City Health Officer.
—The prevailing diseases during the month wer diarrheal diseases, malarial and typho-inalaria fevers. The mortality of the month is highe than that of the preceding month, but compare favorably with the corresponding month of pre-
vious years. July has always been one of ou worst months. On the 3d of July I received a anonymous communication stating that there wa some suspicious sickness on Cannon street, in
South Nashville. I visited the locality and foun four cases of small-pox and varioloid in thre colored families. The houses were quarantined,
and the county health authorities, who under th state laws are the custodians of the county pest-
house and its appurtenances for the removal an treatment of small-pox patients, were immediatel notified and requested to send the ambulance fo the sick as soon as possible. All of the availabl virus in the city was purchased and the inmate of the quarantines and residents of the immediat vicinity were vaccinated. On the morning of the
4th I discovered another c»*e in a colored famil on Patterson street, in the western suburbs of th city. This house was also quarantined, but n virus could be procured to vaccinate the inmates The disease in each instance was easily traced t the steamboat traffic with St. Louis. Both of th bove localities are densely populated negro set-
ments and we were without any appropriatio or other adequate facilities for the suppression o the disease. The mayor, therefore, at the reques of the board of health, convened the city counci in extraordinary session and asked for an appro-
priation to meet the emergency. The city coun-
cil thereupon made an appropriation of $5,000.00,
to be expended in such manner as the board o health might direct, for stamping out the dis-
ease. Virus was ordered by telegraph from tw reliable producing establishments, and twenty-
four physicians were employed and at once put t work in the alleys and tenement houses huntin out and vaccinating the unprotected. S[>ecial an almost exclusive attention was given to the col-
ored race and the poorer class of whites, as th records of this department for previous year show that these classes of our population furnishe more than ninety-five per cent of all the case registered. On the morning of the 4th, Judie
Phillips, who had the disease in the confluen form, died; this left one of the houses free of th disease, but the quarantine was continued ove the remaining inmates as suspects. On the night of the 5th and 6th the pest-house ambulanc transferred the sick and suspects from th three houses to the hospital. During the nex two weeks six other cases were developed in per-
sons who had been exposed to the original cases,
all of whom were promptly removed to the hos-
pital. Having passed through the period of in-
cubation without the development of any mor cases, we can safely assert that this invasian ha been entirely stamped out Decatur county—Dr. J. F. Aydelott, County
Health Officer, Decaturville.—No report received DcKoJb county—Dr. M. L. Wilson, County
Health Officer, Smithville.—No report received Dickson county.—No board organized Dyer county—Dr. J. P. C. Walker, County
Health Officer, Dyeraburg.—The health of thi county for July would compare favorably wit the corresponding month of 1887. The differen forms of malaria constituted the prevailin trouble, next in order the diarrhajas, also som ileo-colitis, usually complicated with bronchitis Dysentery is said to have prevailed in the neigh-
borhood of Newbern Dyersburg—Dr. H. F. Ferguson, President;
Dr. F. Summers, Secretary, City Board of Health.
—No report received Fayetle county—Dr. W. A. Ealy, County Health
Officer, Somerville.—We had a good deal of sick-
nessduring the month of July; bilious and malaria fevers, flux and bowel affections among childre were the most prevalent diseases that we had t contend with Fentress county—Dr. J. Bertram, County Health
Officer, Little Crab.—No report received Frank!in county—Dr. J.C. Shapard, County Health
Officer, Winchester.—There was not much sick-
ness in this county during the month of July, an the cases that di'l occur were mostly mild; a least not of a serious grade. Fevers of a some-
what doubtful type, a remission if not an inter-
mission of mornings, with an evening tempera-
ture of only 101 or 102, a slight diarrhoja or ten-
dency thereto and persisting in spite of treatmen three or four weeks. Scarlet fever prevailed i some parts of the county, which was called ros-
ola by the people and by some of the p vsiciau.

During the month there were a few cases of dys-
entery, more of diarrhoea, and cholera infantu was quite frequent. Whooping cough was occa-
sionally seen Gibson county—Dr. T. J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—For July in Trenton and im-
mediate vicinity health has been good. A fe cases of continued remittent fever of a vtry ob-
stinate character have been met with in the cit limits. Some of them were called typhoid fever,
but the history of the cases showed their malaria origin. Dysentery of a mild type has at time threatened to become troublesome. Children s far are having but little trouble with the summe diseases. There are about eight or ten cases o pertussis in the city. From District 5, Brazil, Dr
Clendennin reports little sickness; a few cases o diarrhoea and bilious fever. One death; age, 93
years. Dr. Davidson, of Dyer, District 21, report health as usual for this season. Dr. A. W Stephenson, of the same place, reports an exces of sickness of rather an asthenic type, with on case of phlegmonous erysipelas—fatal. He als reports a curious freak of nature—a child bor without eyes or nose and having the brain cover-
ed only by its membraues "in the crown of th head." He also reports dysentery of a mild typ which yielded to treatment easily. Dr. Moore, of
Bradford, District 14, reports "only a moderat amount of sickness" during July, consisting o bowel diseases of children, malarial fever unci  few cases of flux, with one death. He reports i difficult to interest the people in the subject o vaccination. Dr. Altman, of District 12, report an increase of sickness in his practice. His pre-
vailing diseases were intermittent and remitten fevers, diarrhoea and dysentery, with one case o typhoid fever. He adds that children have suf-
fered more than usual from bowel diseases. An another fact which I have found to be true, viz:
that malarial fevers yield more slowly than usua to quinine. Dr. Clay, of Rutherford, reports in-
termittent and remittent fevers with dysentery, a prevailing diseases, with one death from pneumo-
nia in a child of fifteen months Milan—M. D. L. Jordan, M. D.—Diarrhoea i adults and children has prevailed to some extent,
but not as much as usual for June. Except a above health is good Trenlon—A. S. Currey, Esq.—Health continue good ax usual at this season. As an indication o prevailing sickness in his practice, Dr. J. T Shackleford reports that, of the eighteen cases o dysentery reported last month, one died on the
4th of July. The patient was 78 years old an worn down with chronic disease of the lungs; al the others recovered. One fatal case of diarrhoe occurred in a patient 88 years old. Twelve cases o remittent fever, not yielding readily to quinine One case congestion of the lungs, yielding to hypo-
dermic injections of morphine and atropia. Eigh cases of dysentery .'seven children and one adult) Several cases of cholera morbus; two of summe complaint. Malarial fevers occurring in severa localities, but not more than usual at this season Giles county—Dr. C. A. Abernathy, County
Health Officer, Pulaski —No report received Grainger county—-Dr. J. H. Campbell, County
Health Officer, Kutledge.—No report received Greene county—Dr. E. B. Smith, County Health
Officer, Greeneville.—No report received Grundy county—Dr. L. P. Barber, Tracy City.—
We have had less sickness than usual in Grund county for the time of the year during the mont of July. Stomach and bowel troubles have bee the most prevalent diseases. The two deaths tha have occurred in this part of the county have bee from summer complaint of children; one cas complicated with whooping cough. A few case of tonsilitis have been noticed. Whooping coug is the only contagious disease Hamblen county—Dr. D. E. Shields, County
Health Officer, Morristown.—No report received Hamilton county—Dr. E. M. Eaton, County
Health Officer, Chattanooga.—-Thehealth of Ham-
ilton county has been remarkably good. The pre-
vailing sickness has been dian-hoeal diseases Hancock county—Dr. Jesse B. Mitchell, County
Health Officer, Datura.—Nothing unusual to re-
port. We yet have in some portions of the count an occasional case of malarial fever. Scattere over the county are some cases of dysentery, wit now and then cholera morbus and the "summe complaint" among children. These compose th sicknees of Hancock county Hardeman county—Dr. Jas. J. Neely, Jr., County
Health Officer, Bolivar.—No report received Hardin county—Dr. J. K. Barlow, County
Health Officer, Savannah.—No report received
Hawkins county—Dr. R. P. Mitchell, County
Health Officer, Rogersville.—We still had dys-
entery raging among us during the last month,
but assumed a milder type. Bu( still there ha been several deaths among infants. Typhoid fe-
ver has prevailed to some extent; a majority o cases yielded to treatment. There have been sev-
eral cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis; one death,
which occurred 9 hours after patient was stricken Cholera infantum and diarrhoea prevail amon children. One death of hemorrhage of the bowels There has been less sickness during the last tw weeks in our commuuity than for several months Obstetrical cases have been on the increase. On case of twins in our village.
I see in the papers and the Bulletin tha variola prevails in several localities in thi state, and that the State Board of Healt calls on the various counties to protect them-
selves from the spread of this disease. There i no county in Tennessee where vaccination ha been so universal as in Hawkins. Our count made liberal appropriation four years ago to ar-
rest this disease. More than $4,000.00 was spen to arrest its ravages. We had about forty case in Big Poor Valley. I was appointed by the cen-
tral committee to take charge of them and es-
tablish a quarantine. I had no idea of the pov-
erty and degradation in our midst. All our sup-
plies, even soap, towels and change of bed clothe and wearing apparel were received from town The disease was of the confluent type. There wa one hovel in which there were eight cases. I same there were two confinements; the mother and infants died in less than twenty-four hour after birth. I will write more about it in future Haywood county—Dr. J. H Howell, County
Health Officer, Brownsville.—No report received Henderson county.—No board organized Henry county—Dr.S. C. Edmunds, County Health

latina, mumps, typhoid fever, tonsilitis, choler morbus, cholera infantum, diarrhoea and dysen-
tery. There is and has been a great deal of dys-
entery, some severe cases, but none fatal. But o the whole I think our county is in a very health condition. Our geographical situation and nat-

alent during July were dysentery and malaria fevers, but not more than usual at this season Early in the month I noticed in the Nashvill papers that a case of small-pox had appeared i that city and goon thereafter some negroes wh had been with it had come to their home in
Christiana in this county. Steps were promptl taken to isolate them and vaccinate all in the vi-
cinity By this means a serious epidemic of thi loathsome disease has doubtless been prevented Thus far only three cases have developed and the are all convalescent Scott county— Dr. County Health

City Board of Health.—We have had four case of scarlet fever and two of diphtheria reporte during July, and one death from the latter Whooping cough is quite prevalent throughou the city, especially in the northern part, called
Chelsea. No fatal cases. The warm weather o the last week of July has caused suffering amon childrrn teething. Ten deaths, attributed t cholera infantum. Adults are suffering with con-
gestion in all its forms, as well as diarrhoea, dys-
entery and malarial troubles. Twelve new case of small-pox have been reported since July 1st All were removed to the pest-house and every pre-
caution taken to prevent its spreading; two fata cases during the month. The first five cases thi month were reported between the 3d and 7th, th next three were landed here by boats between the
7th and 17th, coming from neighboring countr and cities. On July 28th a case was discovered at
213$ Court street, two blocks awav from the in-
fected locality on Monroe street. July 30th thre other cases were found in the old locality, 265
Monroe street. From the 7th of July to the 30t no new cases were in the infected location, 265
Monroe street; in fact, no cases were found in th city during that time except the three landed b boats and the one found at 213$ Court street The three cases found July SOth were little child-
ren who had lived there a long time, and the Ins time it was possible for them.to come in contac with small-pox was July 7th, to the best of m knowledge. Again, on June 2d, Dr. Black re-
ported a case ol small-pox at the city hospital,
also one June 18th and one June 19th. The tw latter were in the hospital when the first cas broke out; in fact, they had both been there som weeks before with chronic troubles and never lef until they were carried away Buffering with small-
pox. From the above the question arises in m mind—is it safe to allow persons held in quaran-
tine because exposed to small-pox, to go free afte ten days have elapsed? There was no way fo the two cases at the city hospital to be expose but the once, and it was sixteen days before th first and seventeen days before the second on took the disease. The last three cases went twen-
ty-three days Smith county—Dr. Frank Swope, County Health
Officer, Carthage.—No report received Stewart county—Dr. B. F. Abernathy, County
Health Officer, Dover.—For the month of Jul there was an increase of sickness over the preced-
ing month, in the order of frequency appearin as follows—In the northwest portion of the coun-
ty, cholera morbus, cholera infantum, acute diar-
rhoea, a few cases of dysentery, a few of intermit-
tent and remittent fever; in the southwest part o the county, several cases of flux and other bowe troubles, with quite an increase of febrile disease including typhoid and typho-malarial fevers. I and around Dover there was less sickness during
July than June. We had a few cases of diar-
rhoea, intermittent and remittent fever and on case of typhoid fever in the town. Mumps ye prevailing north of the Cumberland river, and I
have heard of several cases of dysentery and di-
arrhoea, with some remittent and intermittent fe-
ver. Three or four deaths reported from flux o bowel troubles. So far I have not been able t arouse the people to an interest to the importanc of vaccination against small-pox.

AT GRAND JUNCTION Inspector Prewitt, at Grand Junction, re-
ports under date of the 24th:
"The trains fail to make connection here,
hence it requires more time and vigilance On the Memphis & Charleston railroad, train go East at 12 a.m. and 12 p.m.; West at 3.30
p.m. and 4.45 a.m. Illinois Central railroa trains go North at 2.45 a.m. and 7.45 a.m.;
South at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. You will perceiv it requires all my time, day and night, as it i rarely they are all on time The inspector from Memphis comes ou every night and returns on the morning train.
I shall co-operate with Dr. Jordan, of

formed that some refugees got off the trai north of Birmingham, believed to have th fever."
Inspector Brown, at Cleveland, Tenn., un-
der date of August 25, writes:
"The 3:50 train always has refugees o board, and the trainmen, I think, help the to pass without inspection if they can do s without open violation of the law. The sleep-
ing-carmen will carry refugees through with-
out letting us see them if they can, but I wil try my best to be on the lookout."

under date of August 27:
"No passengers from Florida have passe through the city to-day. I was informed thi afternoon that several parties from Jackson-
ville would board the train to-morrow at Dal-
ton to come to Chattanooga. I immediatel gave the facts to my inspectors and instructe them to look out for these parties and inter-
cept them. Hearing yesterday afternoon tha three cases of yellow fever had broken out in
Atlanta, I immediately wrote to^he Secretar of the Atlanta Board of Health, and here-
with inclose a copy of his reply. From what
I can gather, the doors of Atlanta and Dalto are not as wide open to Florida refugees a they are supposed to be. Inspector Brow came down from Cleveland this morning t see me for conference. He is doing all th inspecting himself, and it will be impossibl for him to inspect the train from Clevelan to Chattanooga, consequently I will apply to-
morrow for an additional man for that line."
The report from Atlanta referred to is a follows:
"There has not been a single case of yello fever in Atlanta this year. If a case shoul be brought here or should occur here, it wil be officially announced through the press im-
mediately. In view of late publications in
Chattanooga papers, would it not be well t give this assurance publicity. A rigid inspec-
tion of trains is maintained, and we will in-
form you by wire of any suspicious cases The woman, Mrs. Miller, of whom I wire you a few days ago, stopped finally at Calhoun Her symptoms, I am informed, have all sub-
sided Yours truly,

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
"Yours of the 30th inst. received thi morning. I instructed my inspectors som time ago to pay particular attention to pas-
sengers from Atlanta, Daltonand Decatur, for
I recognized the fact that it was an easy mat-
ter for refugees to stop over in either of thes places long enough to buy a ticket and rechec their baggage. I do not think that many ref-
ugees coming from those points have elude the vigilance of the officers, for as a rule thei baggage has some mark upon it that betray them. As most of the refugees who com this way come via the Western & Atlanti railroad and the East Tennessee, Virginia &
Georgia railrqad (Georgia division), a deten-
tion station has been established at Boyce an one at Sherman Heights. The stations ar not over a mile apart, and an officer is sta-
tioned at each place to see that the refugee who are put off there do not come into thi city. Most of the refugees board the Cincin-
nati train at Boyce and go north, or they tak the next train to Atlanta. I inspect fourtee trains per day, the first at 4:37 a.m., the las one at 11:40 p.m. Inspectors on the Western
& Atlantic, and on the East Tennessee, Vir-
ginia & Georgia railroads board the trains at
Dalton. The Alabama Great Southern rail-
road is boarded at Rising Fawn; the Memphis
& Charleston railroad is boarded at Stevenson;
the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia rail-
road, main line, is boarded at Cleveland; the
C, R. & C. railroad is boarded justout-side th city limits. The latter is a new road an runs only one regular train a day; the trave is mostly local.
I have the following refugee cases to report:
"F. E. Noble, male, aged 33. Left Jack-
sonville yesterday and boarded Cincinnati
Southern train at Boyce to-day for Cincinnati His baggage had not been disinfected. W. S Robinson, male, aged 25. Left Jacksonvill yesterday and went through to Pittsburg to-
day. He had no baggage. The inspector wh came in on the 55, left Jacksonville, Fla.,
August 11, and is going through to Cincinnati His baggage had not been disinfected. B. R Newcomb accompanied the above name party. He left Jacksonville on the same day,
and is going to Cincinnati. His baggage ha not been disinfected. I would not jet the stop here, but transferred them without dela to the Cincinnati train and stationed an office near to see they did not leave the coach."
The following report is from Dr. James E Reeves, who was appointed by the State Boar of Health to go South and there personall inspect the different quarantines at this tim in force, both State and National, with th view of determining what protection, if any,
Tennessee derives from such quarantines:
Waycros8, Ga., Aug. 31,1888.
J. D. Plunket, M. D., President State Boar of Health, Nashville, Tenn.:
Sir—For several hours I have been in con-
sultation with Surg. Maj. Wm. H. Hutton,
the representative of the Marine Hospital
Service, who has charge of the quarantine ser-
vice at this station, and learned from him th following facts: Outside of Jacksonville,
where the epidemic is increasing day by day,
(and will continue to increase, probably, fo the next twenty days), the disease is also
Sresent at Plant City. Manatee, and Pabl leach, with one death reported at Sweet
Water. There has been no outbreak of th disease North and West of the line of the
Florida Railway and Navigation Company, o the line from Cedar Keys via Gainesville and
Callahan to Fernandina. The late order is-
sued from the office of the Supervising Sur-
geon General of the Marine Hospital Service,
if faithfully observed and enforced, will com-
pletely bottle up Jacksonville, and thus lesse the danger from a spread of the disease. Th following is a copy of the order above al-
luded to:
CIRCULAR Regulations for the prevention of the sprea of yellow fever from certain infected places i the State of Florida:
Treasury Department,

General, United States
Marine Hospital Sevice,
Washington, D. C, Aug. 28,1888 In accordance with the act of April 29.
1878. and appropriation acts authorizing th maintenance of quarantine at points of danger,
the following regulations are framed to assis in the work of preventing the spread of yello fever, now prevailing as an epidemic in cer-
tain towns in the State of Florida.
1. A camp of refuge for persons from in-
fected places in Florida is hereby established,
to be under command of Passed Assistant
Surgeon Guiteras, on the south bank of the
St. Mary's river, near the crossing of the Sa-
vannah, Florida & Western railroad, to b known as Camp Perry. Temporary quarantin stations are hereby established under directio of Surgeon Hutton, Marine Hospital Service,
near Waycross, Ga., and Live Oak, Fla.

Those at DuPont, Ga., and Chattahoochee
River Junction are hereby discontinued.
2. At the stations aforesaid, an inspectio will be made of all persons, baggage, mail, an express arriving by rail from points South;
and in case of arrival of any person, mail, bag-
gage, or express matter capable of conveyin infection, coming from an infected place o place not known to be healthy, ps shown b recent inspection reports, then such perso shall either be returned to the original plac of embarkation or to Camp Perry, at his o her option, and the baggage of such perso shall be held for fumigation, and fumigate under the direction of the officer in charge Mail matter from infected places will be fu-
migated under the direction of the Railway
Mail Service under orders already issued b that service.
3. xVll persons arriving in Camp Perry wil be under the orders of the commanding officer,
and will not depart the camp without permis-
sion until ten days shall have elapsed from th date of their departure from an infected place.
A special daily train will run between Jack-
sonville and Camp Perry, for the purpose o conveying persons from Jacksonville and suc other business as may be incident thereto, an at the expiration of the detention period suc persons will be taken to Waycross, and the allowed to proceed to their destination with-
out further detention.
4. Railway agents, conductors or persons i charge of railway trains south of and in-
cluding those of the Savannah, Florida &
Western Railroad will not receive person from infected places on board trains, excep to the refuge camp, as provided in paragrap one of this circular, and sleeping cars will no be allowed to proceed south of Waycross, 6a.,
until the cessation of the epidemic.
5. An additional refuge camp, under th same regulations as those governing Camp
Perry, will be established in the mountains of
North Carolina (the site hereafter to be deter-
mined) as soon as practicable Joun B. Hamilton,
Supervising Surgeon General Approved:
C. S. Fairchild,
Secretary of the Treasury It is really assuring to witness the seemin unconcern of the people of Waycross, onl seventy-six miles distant from the scourge city of Jacksonville, on the subject of yello fever; yet this has been the gateway throug which thousands of refugees have fled fo places of safety in the upper country of Geor-
gia, Alabama and Tennessee My confidence in the effectiveness of th quarantine and the public safety afforde thereby, has been greatly strengthened by m investigations of the system here enforced Maj. Hutton seems to be the right man in th right place, and will suffer no violation of hi orders. To-day the disinfecting station, tw miles below here, has been shut up for th reason that neither a passenger nor piece o baggage was brought through from Jackson-
ville. I have been assured that Camp St Mary's, thirty miles from Jacksonville, is be-
coming an acceptable resort, and that alread over 200 tents have been spread and occupied,
with room for hundreds more. The locatio is high and dry, in a word, the site is mos admirably suited to the emergency. Th truth is now plainly seen that the only suc-
cessful method of combatting the spread o yellow fever, or stamping out infected centers,
is to break up the population of scourge cities or towns to the greatest possible exten by offering temporaay homes on healthy an inviting camp-grounds to all classes of citizens,
and to throw around all a cordon of quaran-
tine so close that no one can overstep its line If the stringent means and the relief whic are now enforced and supplied had been in-
augurated two or three weeks ago, there woul have been fewer cases in Jacksonville, an less fear in the public mind of the genera spread of the disease. My observation, whil on this journey of inspection service, has full satisfied me of the worse than folly of ap-
pointing unskilled persons—common police-
men—as quarantine inspectors. It is simpl dangerous waste of official confidence. T emphasize this truth, I could give some ludi-
crous examples, if trifling with a serious sub-
ject were a becoming part of my duty The present lamentable experience in Flor-
ida—the feeling of her citizens, the derange-
ment of her business, not to mention the sick-
ness and deaths among the multitude at hom in the stricken city—will not soon be forgot-
ten; and if the costly experience in the los both of life and property shall secure better

methods of protection for the future, then th sacrifice will not have been entirely withou benefit. The culpability of the State authori-
ties of Florida will no doubt be a subject fo discussion by the next Legislature; for it i safe to say, if the State Board of Health ha been given the means it asked for, the diseas would have been stamped out with the firs case in Jacksonville The United States Government, also, is no less to be blamed. She has undisputed con-
trol of coast quarantine, yet, every year, case of yellow fever are brought from Havana an other places in Cuba. Besides why, with th thousands times told danger of yellow fever i the Southern ports, was there not preparatio made for the coining of the unwelcome guest?
Why not already on hand cars specially con-
structed for the work of quick and thoroug disinfection of mails, baggage, etc.?
All these and many other just counts of in-
dictment I could make against the authoritie in the case Finally I think you may assure the peopl of Tennessee that they will escape the infec-
tion. With the new and better order o things at Wayeross for the public safety, wil there be also greater security to the State of
Tennessee. I go next to Macon; thence to
Columbus to see that these two importan points are properly guarded against all per-
sons from infected districts in Florida Your obedient servant,
James E. Reeves.

AT PULASKI Inspector Abernathy reports under date of
September 1:
"I have commenced a daily run down to
Decatur, in order that I may be able to in-.
spect the trains and to prevent passenger from Florida checking their baggage to tha place and rcchecking to other points. I fin that the quarantine officers there are ver vigilant and strict, and do not let persons wh have been in Florida, even in portions of the
State not infected with yellow fever, stop in
Decatur. As an evidence of their rigid quar-
antine, a Mr. Stewart, commercial tourist from
Louisville, Ky., who had been on a busines trip to Pensacola for half a day, was denied th privilege of stopping off for dinner on yester-
day. So it is hardly possible for fugitives t check baggage to Decatur and recheck with-
out detection—in fact the quarantine on the
Louisville & Nashville Railroad below is s strict it will be almost impossible for fugitive to escape inspection. When they understan the nature of the quarantine in Tennessee the do not attempt to escape inspection. Th travel from Florida to-day was very light Only a few passengers from Pensacola, Fla.,
were found, all of whom had certificates fro proper authorities, and were going throug the Siat«. I gave them certificates."
AT CLEVELAND Inspector Brown reports under date of Sep-
tember 1:
"Dalton train, 12:05 p. m.—J. C. Turnlyan wife, from St. Augustine, Fla., for Brooklyn,
N. Y. Gentleman aged 39, hair brown, mus-
tache dark and heavy, height 5 feet 9 inches,
weight 163 pounds; wife aged 27, light blue
«yes, fair complexion. Both had certificates.
"Dalton train, 3:50 a. m.—J. W. Tawns,
from Orange county, Fla., for Philadelphia;
age 40, height 6 feet, sandy hair and mustache,
blue eyes, weight 180; had certificate."
AT PULASKI Inspector Abernathy reports under date of
September 2:
"No refugees passed up the road to-day The passengers from Florida were all from th western part of the State, viz.: J. H. Carpen-
ter, aged 36, Pensacola, destination Johns-
town, Pa.; G.'W. Banfill and' wife, aged, re-
spectively, 29 and 28, destination Cincinnati;
Mrs. Chas. Everett and daughter, Leta, aged
40 and 6, destination Cincinnati. All of the had certificates from health authorities. I
find from my conversation with conductors an passengers that the quarantine is so very rigi at Montgomery, Birmingham and Decatur tha it is impossible almost for refugees to escap detection. It is my opinion that this rigi quarantine has kept many refugees from com-
ing out of Florida on the Louisville & Nash-
ville Kailroad into and through Tennessee And now that refugee trains have been put o the Savannah, Florida & Western Road by th government for the special benefit of those wh desire to leave Jacksonville, I think travel o the Louisville & Nashville over Tennessee wil not be so great, having to encounter so muc quarantine and inspection as it does in this di-
rection.
"I failed to mention the name of Miss An-
nette Rogers, aged 30, from Pascoe county,
Florida, whose destination was Louisville, Ky She had a certificate from local health author-
ities."

Ooltewah—the Mr. Charlton of whom I wrot you last night. He had no baggage and wa not allowed by the local authorities of Oolte-
wah to stop there. He walked from Ooltewa to this city, where an officer took him i charge. I sent him through to Knoxville to-
night. I have had an inspector on the road be-
tween here and Cleveland since the 29th ult.'

AT PULASKI Inspector Abernathy reports under date of
September 3:
"Found no refugees from yellow fever to-
day. Thos. C. Watson and wife, from Pensa-
cola, Florida, were on the early morning train Their destination was Nashville, Tenn. The had certificates from Health Officer of Pensa-
cola. I have investigated very closely th checking of baggage to Decatur and the re-
checking from there to other points by refu-
gees. Such a thing is hardly possible now,
for the inspectors at Decatur board all train some distance below the city and investigat their baggage very closely; and it is hardl possible for them to recheck again, and, i fact, no refugee escapes detection. I thin our southern border is well protected, and a the situation grows worse, I shall try to b more vigilant."

DR. REEVES AT COLUMBUS, OA The following reports are from Dr. James
E. Reeves, of Chattanooga, the special investi-
gating agent of the Tennessee Board in Geor-
gia:
Columbus, Ga., Sept. 2,1888.
J. D. Pluuket, M. D., President Stale Boar of Health, Nashville, Tenn.:
Sir-—On entering this progressive city I
found not less care in guarding its railway ap-
proaches than is exercised at Macon. In fact,
no person who is a stranger can get into th city without first subscribing to the form o oath I sent you from Macon. Steamboats ar not allowed to land their passengers and freigh on the city side of the Chattahoochee river,
but may do so at a village below the city,
where a rigid inspection is made. You may,
also, trust Columbus that she will keep clea of yellow fever. The city authorities gave m an earnest welcome because of my mission Very truly,
James E. Reeves.
DR. REEVES AT MACON, OA Macon, Ga., Sept. 3,1888.
J. D. Pluuket, M. D., President State Boar of Health, Nashville, Tenn.:
Sir—I beg to inform you that after makin my communication from Waycross, I accepte an invitation from Marine Hospital Surgeon
Hutton to visit with him the fumigating work located two or three miles south, on the line o the Savannah, Florida & Western Railway As reported in my preceding letter, the work were idle that day because there were neithe passengers nor baggage to be inspected an handled The manner of dealing with mail matter i simply throwing "a tub to the whale," to in-
nocently deceive all sorts aud conditions o people. The process may be briefly told a follows: Letters and other mail matter ar struck with a hammer having on its face sev-
eral awl or nail-like projections which perfo-
rate the paper and merely permit the perfum of burning sulphur (from an iron pot in th center of an ordinary box car) to pass throug the little holes thus made. Let any one tr the experiment of punching a row of smal holes through several folds of writing paper,
and he will see that thereby the layers of pa-
per are held all the more tightly together. I a word, the folded letter sheet is about effect-
ually sealed against exposure to the sulphur-
ous vapor as if no perforations had been made
—the fumes only passing through the littl holes. If the method of disinfection were
250° Fah. of dry heat, as practiced by the Ten-
nessee State Board of Health, at Memphis, in
1879, or refrigeration at a temperature of 32„
Fah., then a few hours of exposure would ef-
fectually accomplish disinfection of all article of mails or baggage. But why disinfect the .
clean paper in the mails, while no thought i given the possibility that, the thousands of fil-
thy bank notes which are in circulation—man of them, no doubt, having been pocketed an handled by persons sick of yellow fever—ma with greater probability be carriers of the in-
fection? To more effectually and convenient-
ly accomplish the work of disinfection, a larg frame building, containing several rooms, is i process of erection and will be ready for us within the next few days.
I reached this city this morning, passin without difficulty the outpost where I found  trusty sentinel who was armed with a paper t which I subscribed my name, swearing that I
had not been at either of the infected places in
Florida within the last fifteen days. I me the Mayor and City Board of Health, also the
Health Officer, Dr. Morgan, and soon learne that a sharp inspection was made on all pas-
senger and freight conveyances entering th city. You may confidently rely on Macon do-
ing her duty in the matter of quarantine Yours truly,
James E. Reeves.

or two. I could scarcely believe my own eye as I read the press dispatch that Surgeon Gen Hamilton had weakened under the pressure o an unreasonable indiguation expressed by the
Jacksonville authorities, and committed th serious blunder of revoking his order of Aug.
28, establishing Camp Perry at St. Mary's riv-
er, thirty-six miles from the stricken city,
where really handsome provisions had bee made for the care of persons who wished to ge outside of the radius of infection. The start-
ling news not only proved true, but the whole
South has become panic-stricken. Fortunate-
ly there is to be a conference with Surgeon
Gen. Hamilton this evening at Augusta, aud have already accepted an invitation from his
Excellency, Gov. Gordon, to participate in th proceedings Dr. Jerome Cochran, the distinguished san-
■ itarian of Alabama, has likewise been invite to the conference by Gov. Gordon and will g over with me. He, equally with myself, re-
grets the dangerous relaxation of the order re-
quiring all persons to be quarantined for te days at Camp Perry, where not only pure wa-
ter and good food is supplied, but a postoffic and telegraph station have been established fo the special convenience of the camp citizens For the negroes there have been erected sev-
eral hundred huts, but none of these peopl have entered them. All persons who are dis-
charged from the detention camp are give three days' rations and a clean bill of healt certificate Very respectfully,
James E. Ref.ves.
THE CONFERENCE AT AUGUSTA Auousta, Ga., September 3, 1888 Dr. J. 1). Plunket, M. D.. President Stale Board of Health, Nashville, Tumi.:
Sir: Before this reaches you you will hav read in the Associated Press dispatches th reassuring news that no more refugees from
Jacksonville will be allowed to pass out of the
State, without having been quarantined for a least ten days at one of the camps which ha been specially provided for that purpose. I few words I may tell you that the result of th conference just closed in this city will give al needful security against the spread of yello fever outside of Florida. How sorrowfully i must have been written by the authorities tha fear had taken the place of their assume bravado which for the past several weeks h been a menace and cause of great alarm to he neighboring sister cities. They themselve answer. The fact that Atlanta no longer in-
vites the bringing into her midst of person who have been exposed to the infection at
Jacksonville is proof of return to reason,
and we shall be abundantly thankful if sh does not have to repent in mourning for he folly. The supposed immunity of certai places from yellow fever is as unreliable a is the uncertainty of personal exposure t the infection, namely : because a man who ha been with the disease at one time escapes th infecton, that is no proof that he will not suc-
cumb at some future exposure when the at-
mospheric influences and feveral dependencie whatever they may be. are more favorable t its propagation.
I am sure the whole South will breath easier from the good news the press will giv in the morning. The resolutions adopte were fully discussed and unamimously ap-
proved. Surgeon-General Hamilton admitte the danger of letting out, without detentio in camp, persons so recently exposed, but gav the reason for it that the pressure for a let u from his order of August 28 seems to war-
rant the experiment. He assured the con-
ference that there should be no further im-
mediate arrivals from Jacksonville, and tha in every particular the order of August 28
would be enforced regardless of indignatio meetings and all other-influences that migh be brought forward against him because o the performance of his duty. I shall leave a midnight for Chattanooga for rest and to mak further report Your obedient servant,
James E. Reeves.

ians say they have done less this month than any-
August since they began practice. Sickness,

tirely, free from scarlet fever, measles, roseola,
whooping-cough, and mumps, during the mont of August. This is an exception, as one or mor of these diseases are generally on hand. Th principal disease of the month was a mild typhoi fever. A few cases were of a grave form, an two or three of them terminated fatally. Choler infantum was frequent, and diarrhoea and dysen-
tery were occasional Gibson county—Dr. T.J. Happel, County Health
Officer, Trenton.—For the month of August I re-
port in my own practice a remarkably health month; remittent fever was the prevailing typ of sickness It has been remarkable, th;it ther has been but a few cases of intermittent fever a compared with the number of remittent cases One case of remittent fever terminated fatally,
after having yielded completely to quinine, car-
bolic and iodine, developing a pernicious type,
after a complete cessation for four days, In tha case there was imprudent exposure—nursing  sick child. Dysentery in adults has been secure in my own work Next in frequency, I plac bronchitis in children. I have treated a fe cases of cholera infantum. In the latter part of
July I sent postals to nearly all the physicians i the county. A tew replied. I am still endeavor-
ing to get reliable, trustworthy reports from al quarters of the county. Dr. Clendennin, of Dis-
trict 5, reports almost no sickness up to a wee ago, but since then atypical case of typhoid fever Dr. Altmon, of District 12, reports one case o complicated typhoid fever, but scarcely any othe sickness. Dr. T. J. Moore, of District 17, report an epidemic of bronchitis among children, com-
plicated with malarial fever. One fatal case, a infant of six months. Nearly all the infants an children were attacked. The epidemic is now a an end. With that exception, August was a re-
markably healthy month. Dr. Clay, of Ruther-
ford, District 9, reports one death from dropsy Malarial fevers and diarrhoeas were the prevail-
ing diseases, but easily controlled; a health month. Dr. Caldwell, of Medina, District I, re-
ports several cases of typhoid fever; one fatal An abundance of malarial fever up to ten day ago. Since then three cases of dysentery in th same family. All recovered. Dr. C. T. Love, of
Humboldt, reports not much sickness; some dys-
entery, and a few cases of biliousness. Whoop-
ing-cough all over the city; more cases of abor-
tion than usual, owing to the enervating effects o heat in the first half of the month Milan—M. D. L. Jordan, M. D.—With the e ception of a few cases of malarial fever, the tow and vicinity are healthv Trenton—A. S. Currey, Esq.—Dr. J. T. Shackle-
ford reports considerable sickness for the month Prevailing diseases have been flux, and biliou remittent fevers; seen but one case of typhoi fever, that in District 21. No deaths. Dr. A. E Turner, Yorkville, reports malarial type of fevers,
with some malignancy attending them. Othe localities report health good, with no serious case of sickness Giles county—Dr. C. A. Abernatby, County
Health Officer, Pulaski.— During the month of
August we have had a good deal of fatal sicknes in our county. Dysentery has prevailed in vari-
ous portions of the county. On Buchanan's Creek,
six miles east of Pulaski, it has prevailed in  most malignant epidemic form. In one neighbor-
hood, twelve or fifteen cases have occurred wit six or seven deaths, out of the number sick. Suc a malignant form of the disease has not existed i our county for several years past. A death fro it occurred in Pulaski on the 2Sth. However, i is not epidemic here. There have been the usua number of cases of intermittent and remitten fevers in the county. One case of typhoid feve in Pulaski is reported. A child on a visit to Pu-
laski and Giles county from Nashville, wa stricken with diphtheria, taken back to Nashville,
and died there about the middle of last week, o that disease. Rotheln is prevailing in Pulask and vicinity as an epidemic Grainger county—Dr. J. H. Campbell, County

In the vicinity of Como the sam disease, in a mild form, lias prevailed, and tw deaths have been caused thereby. Within the las week there had been developed all over th county corvza and bronchitis, but not so severe a to disable many. I have seen one case of pneu-
monia, and heard of two others. I have heard o several cases of acute rheumatism. There ha been a remarkable falling off of the various ma-
larial diseases, and no typhoid fever now exists i the county. Diarrhcea among children has abou ceased. Within the last ten days there have oc-

Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, Oct. 16, 1888.
/. D. Plunket, M. D., President State Board of
Health:
Sir—The work of the Board during the pas quarter has been the stamping out of an incipien small-pox epidemic in July, and the isolating th entire 8tate of Tennessee from a threatened inva-
sion of yellow fever. In each instance th greatest success has ensued, proving most sat-
isfactorily the perfection of the machinery now i the sanitary service of the State Small-pox appeared in the two largest cities of
Tennessee. In a few weeks, and at a small ex-
pense, it was stifled—a very striking contrast wit any previous experience with this disease. Ou people, however, must keep wide awake, for ther are significant indications of danger during th approaching winter The yellow fever, originating in Florida an breaking out in Alabama and Mississippi, ha caused an alarm without precedent and an inter-
ruption to commerce without example. Tennessee,
from its long extended frontiers and many grea lines of transit, was peculiarly liable to invasion;
yet such has been the prompt and energetic actio of the Executive Committee in the work of in-
spection and isolation as thoroughly to preserv the entire State intact. It may be truthfully sai that this Board has thus gained a national repu-
tation for efficiency and foresight At an early day an elaborate report will be mad by the Executixe Committee. In the meantim the details of the daily operations will appear i the Bulletin The hearty co-operation of the Governor of Ten-
nessee and other State officials has been no smal help in giving the timely financial aid which wa so essential, and which had been withheld by th last General Assembly Herewith is appended a list of the contribution to the library during the past quarter:

Secretary Dr. Sims, from Committee on Prisons and
Charitable Institutions, stated that he was no engaged in preparing a full report which h had hoped to have presented to this meeting,
but would only now offer the following resolu-
tion, which was adopted:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Board, no as in the past, that by every consideration of pub-
lic policy the present system of prison managemen should be changed with as little delay as possible The present lease of the penitentiary will expir in two years, and being at variance with all en-
lightened theories of prison management, this
Board is unalterably opposed to a renewal of th lease after its termination. The present State pris-
on being wholly unsuited and insufficient for th purposes intended, and its location being a con-
stant menace to the health of the capital city o the State, the State Board of Health would recom-
mend and- earnestly urge that a new site be selecte and a new prison erected before the termination o the present lease, with a view to the abandonmen of the leaW system and the adoption of a priso and prison system in keeping with the enlightene civilization of the age Dr. Safford, from Committee on Water Sup-
ply, said he had recently visited several valuabl mineral springs in the State, and upon these, to-
gether with an investigation which he desire to soon make of the water supply of Memphi from the thirty artesian wells lately opened a that point, he would offer a full report at a early date for publication in the Bulletin Dr. Wright, from Committee on School Hy-
giene, reported great recent improvements i the heating, ventilation and sewerage of the
Clarksville public schools. He announce that he would report fully on the success o these improvements at the next meeting. H considered this announcement due the author-
ities at Clarksville, inasmuch as in a previou report he had criticised defects in said schools Dr. Plunket, from Committee on Vital Sta-
tistics, stated that he had given the subjec much careful thought and labor, as to each o the past five Legislatures he had presented

carefully prepared bills, covering a system o registration of births, marriages and deaths for
, Tennessee, and only once (April 5, 1881), di he succeed in having the subject considere favorably. This bill was, however, repeale on March 28,1883; so we are to-day practicall where this committee first begun its labors. H asked the Board for such additional instruc-
tions or suggestions as the situation required,
looking to bringing this matter before the ap-
proaching session of the General Assembly After a full interchange of views, in which al agreed to the paramount importance of thi subject, the committee was requested to perse-
vere in their efforts until success was attained Dr. Thornton, from Committee on Epidem-
ics, said the Bulletin published each mont a full report from the local health authoritie throughout the State upon the health in Ten-
nessee, but as suggested by Dr. Plunket, h would soon make a careful digest of these re-
ports covering the past three years, the perio for which they run President Plunket made a verbal report o the operation of the Quarantine established b this Board upon August 16th, and its results Not a single case of yellow fever occurred i the State during the time it was in operation Dr. Thornton offered the following resolu-
tion which, after commendatory remarks by-
each member present, was adopted unani-
mously:
Boohed, That the thanks of this Board are du and hereby tendered to Dr. J. D. Plunket, Chair-
man of the Executive Committee, for his abl and economical management of the State
Quarantine and Inspection Service during the pas summer as against the yellow fever infected local-
ities in the South Resolved, That the regular per diem pay be al-
lowed Dr. Plunket from the inauguration of thi service, August 16, to date Dr. Wright moved that Dr. Plunket be re-
quested to attend as delegate from this Boar the proposed meeting of the "Conference of
State Boards of Health," to be held in Wash-
ington, D. C, in December next Dr. Plunket stated that owing to some pri-
vate engagements, it would be impossible fo him to attend at that time Dr. Safford moved that Dr. Thornton be ap-
pointed such delegate, with Dr. Sims as alter-
nate. Adopted Dr. Thornton offered the following resolu-
tion, which was adopted:
Resolved, That this Board repeat its resolution of April 24, 1888 (see State Board of Health
Bulletin, Vol. III., No. 10, p. 116), in regard to a
National Bureau of Health, which is substantiall that the Federal Congress establish a National Bu-
reau of Health to prevent the introduction of epi-
demic diseases into this country by maratime quar-
antine, and the spread of such diseases from one
State to another,should they be introduced. Also,
that this Board now calls upon other State and lo-
cal Boards to co-operate with it through their rep-
resentatives in Congress to enact necessary laws t this end. That the Secretary of this Board be in-
structed to furnish a copy of this resolution to eac member of Congress from Tennessee, and to the

Lawty, Fla. The fever growing worse, they wer on their way to Sioux, Dak. They had certificat stating above facts; baggage fumigated; gav them certificates and passed them on. B. L Baldwin and wife, from Ocala, Fla., and J. L
Dawes and wife, from Quincy, Fla., were also o the train going north. Their destination was Kan-
sas City and Washington, D. C. All had certifi-
cates from local health authorities. I found sev-
eral pieces of baggage from Jacksonville, some o them belonging to parties not on the train, as I
could not find owners. They were checked to St Louis and Chicago, so I let them go on."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees to-day. I met the conductors on the Memphis
& Charleston Kailroad at Corinth, Miss., who as-
sured me they did not put off any at Corinth However, I inspected all baggage at the baggag office there, as well as on the west-bound train o the same railroad. I require passengers to giv me proof of home and destination, which the readily do if they are not trying to evade the quar-
antine, either by letter addressed to them, or b sundry other ways."

SI ATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN September 5th Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "The Chatta-
nooga Board of Health now require passenger from Atlanta to this city to present properl signed certificates of health, thus closing the onl avenue by which refugees can enter this city. M inspectors are efficient and careful, and with th system adopted of having each passenger to sig an affidavit (a copy of which was sent you), statin whereabouts for the past fifteen days, etc., I ca see no possibility of a suspicious case reaching thi city. No refugees have been reported to me to-
day."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "I passe one man from Southern Georgia who had a cer-
tificate from the Alabama inspector, but h could not identify himself. He acknowledge that he lived in Florida last year. But as he wa en route to Texas, I passed him on. Rev. Kim-
mons and wife, of Fhvrida, had a certificate t the effect that he had been in Mississippi since
August 6. I passed him to Corinth, Miss., to-day,
where he used to live."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors report nothing unfavorable to-day."
September 6th On September 6th the following general orde was issued:
Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, Sept 6, 1888 It is ordered by the State Board of Health that,
until otherwise notified, no refugee from an in-
fected point be allowed to stop in Tennessee unles he or she have been in camp of detention ten days,
baggage has been disinfected, and each holds  certificate of health.
J. D. Plunk et, President Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "Dalton train,
3:50 a. m.—James Murrel left Bordman, Mario county, Flu., Sept.3; destination, (Hade Springs,
Va.; white, age 27. Had certificate from healt officer. Baggage sent on ahead without fumiga-
tion. I gave him one of our certificates. Dalto train 12:05 missed Southern connection."
Chattanooga- Inspector Lynch: "No refugee have been reported to me by the train inspector to-day."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Since m last report (September 5) the following person have been found on the trains coming Nort into our State from Florida: E Reese, white,
age 18, residence Pcnsacola, Fla., destination
Clarksville, Tenn.; C. H. Simpson, age 20, Miss
Ida Simpson, age 16, A. C. Simpson, age 18,
all white, residence Pensacola, Fla., destination
New York city; Miss Babette Smith, age 30, resi-
dence Warrington, Fla., destination New Yor city; also from Argo, Fla., I found George \V. C Littell, white, age 48, wife and three children,
Pearl, Weaver and Louise, apes40, 11, 8 and 4. I
questioned him very closely, hut he was in posses-
sion of certificates from local health authoritie properly signed and sealed; their destination was
St. Joseph, Mo. It has been several days sinc any passenger has come direct from Jacksonvill or any other yellow fever infected point over the
Louisville & Nashville Railroad into Tennessee,
and I am satisfied that it is due to the very effec-
tive local quarantine methods adopted in Florida.
I am informed by parties coming from the wester part of the State of Florida that they hav adopted a most rigid quarantine in each county,
and that they have an inspector at each count line; that they forbid any passenger from an in-
fected district coming into their midst, and tha they require parties who desire to enter the car to show certificates from health officers and other to establish the point where they started from,
and that they have not been exposed to yello fever contagion before they are admitted on th cars. This, I think, gives us in Tennessee addi-
tional security, and is one of the causes why w have so few refugees over this line."
Grand Junction—Iuspector Prewitt: "Som refugees passed West this morning. They, haw-
ever, had certificates, and as they were goin through the State I passed them."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees from
Florida have passed on trains since last report.''
Memphis—-Inspector Ford: "The Train Inspec-
tor reports nothing suspicious to-day except th following: Inspector Perry, on the Memphis A
Charleston railroad, arrived at 6:10 a. m. to-day,
reporting that he found Mr J. E. Murtha an wife and daughters, Annie, Mary, Sarah, Birdi and Maud from Jacksonville, Fla., with a certifi-
cate of health from Surgeon at a marine hospital,
stating that they had not been subject to any in-
fection for thirty days, and that they were e route to Little Rock, Ark., and that they left o the train for that place at 6:55 a. m. this day."

Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch : " I have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. I have instructed th inspector on the East Tennessee, Virginia A Geor-
gia Railroad that runs between here and Cleve-
land, to give Inspector Brown all the assistanc possible that he can. Passengers from Atlanta to
Chattanooga must now present properly signe health certificates or they will not be allowed t enter the city."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees to report to-day. I commend the action o the Slate Board of Health relative to refugees.*

age 38. All refugees I have met were white, wit the exception of a yellow nurse girl, reported las week."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "I have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. Owing to the heavy rain we have had for the past week travel from all di-
rections has been unusually light. The Chatta-
nooga quarantine officers are faithful and vigilan and are obeying instructions to the letter. Th system we have adopted is an excellent one an nothing short of an entire stoppage of all trave could be very effective. I am constantly going ou upon the various trains that come into this cit and I find the trainmen always ready and willin to give me all the information they can. I do no hesitate to say that it is as difficult for a refuge to enter Chattanooga as it is for a camel to pas through the eye of a needle."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Since last re-
port Joseph Gault, white, age 21 from Ocala, Fla.,
destination Robinson, III.; Thos. V. Porter, white,

I found Emma McCardell and five children, Rich-
ard, Agnes, Edward, Anna and Laura, aged, re-
spectively, 48, 15, 10, 8, 5 and 3 years. They ha no certificates or evidence that they were from St Andrews Bay, Fla., but I found from the bag-
gageiuaeter that their baggage was checked fo bt. Paul, Minn., and I let (hem go on, as the were not going to stop in the State. Also I found
E. A. Wallace, from Pensacola, Fla., age 28, white,
destination Evansville, Ind. Otherwise nothin suspicious has been found."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Passe men west and north to-day from South Georgi and Alabama, where they had certificates and ev-
idence to prove they had not been in Florida i ten or fifteen days. I was inclined to the belie that a few of them were indeed aMid truth Florid-
ians. As the west bound train was late we did no reach the Junction until 8 p. in."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees wer found on trains of either of the roads under m inspection on yesterday's trip."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors report nothing from Florida to-day except th transit of the two pieces of baggage alluded to i my report of 7th inst., being stamped or labeled,
'Fumigated at Gattman, Miss., on 7th inst.' I
saw them transferred to the Kansas City depot Train Inspector O'Brien on the Louisville & Nash Railroad reported a consignment of household ef-

DR. JAS. E. REEVES,
of Chattanooga, whom the State Board of Healt sent to make investigatious concerning the quar-
antine regulations and sanitary condition through
Georgia, sent in the following report:
Chattanooga, Tenn., Sept. 8,1888.
J. D. Ptunkel, M.D., President State Board of Health,
Nashville, Tenn.:
Sir—I am sure I shall never cease to be thank-
ful for the providential opportunity given me o participating in the conference at Augusta on
Monday evening, the 4th inst., between his Excel-
lency, Gov. Gordon, of Georgia, and Surgeon-Gen-
eral Hamilton, of the Marine Hospital Service The arrangement for the conference, because of th emergency of the situation, was the work of bu a day—in fact, of but a few hours by telegraph,
and if my movements from place to place had bee less rapid I should have missed the very clima of opportunity to represent the State Board of
Health of Tennessee in its industrious efforts t prevent yellow fever from finding a lodgment with-
in our border. If the terms of the fair under-
standing with Surgeon-General Hamilton ar faithfully regarded, namely, that all persons from
Jacksonville and oiher infected localities in Flor-
ida, shall be detained in quarantine for ten days,
and that all articles whatsoever of baggage an clothing or other personal effects of the travele shall be thoroughly disinfected, and after this  certificate shall be furnished by the commandin officer of the quarantine camp or station settin forth the above-named facts, then there need b no fear of yellow fever in Tennessee. Besides th well organized precautions embodied in the orde of the Surgeon-General of the Marine Hospital,
bearing date of Aug. 28, and reaffirmed at the con-
ference at Augusta, it should be remembered tha up to the present date yellow fever does not pre-
vail in epidemic form in Florida outside of Jack-
sonville. Indeed, with the well-known few excep-
tions, the State of Florida was never more gener-
ally healthy than at present; yet, owing to th universal panic among its citizens, there is com-
plete obstruction to travel; even from county t county and town to town, in districts more than  hundred miles away from Jacksonville, Tampa,
Manatee, Plant City and other points at whic cases of yellow fever have been reported. Me-
thodical, sensible, humane quarantine in man towns and counties has given way very nearly t mob violence in the midst of the general confusion At many cross-roads and other dangerous point the shotgun quarantine is the influence whic prevents freedom of travel, either pedestrian,
horseback or railway. Independent of county an municipal quarantines and shotgun volunteers,
there are stationed at all the outlets of railwa lines, north and west, careful inspectors appointe by the Marine Hospital Service, and a perfect sys-
tem of passes, even from healthy localities, is in

force, and the surveillance is day by day becom-
ing more and more effective Outside of the Florida line, at all of the citie and towns wherever the traveler goes, inspector are on the watch, so that it is almost impossibl for a Floridian or any person from that Stat within the last fifteen days, unless by certificat of discharge from quarantine, to get into Tennes-
see. Even Atlanta, notwithstanding the idle,reck-
less boast that yellow fever cannot be propagate within her limits, has maintained a secret, clos watch for suspects and had hospital physician,
ambulance and nurses, all ready for the care o the first case. Now, however, the authorities o that city seem unwilling to longer bare thei bosoms to the merciless infection and are becom-
ing anxious for the public safety. In proof, se the following dispatches sent yesterday:
"Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 7.—The following dis-
patch was sent to-day: Surgeon-General Hamil-
ton: Atlanta relies upon the Camp Perry quaran-
tine and the decision of the Augusta conference Can we depend upon direct official notice fro you in case this plan should be modified o changed? Answer.
"James B. Baird,
"Secretary Board of Health."
With Atlanta's return to reason, the States of
Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi,
have all the safeguards that can possibly b thrown around them. Finding such complete in-
spection of all railway passengers to Waycross,
Jessup, Brunswick, Macon, Columbus and othe stations, I deemed it unnecessary to go into South
Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi for the pur-
pose of observing their systems of quarantine,
State, county and municipal, and was on my re-
turn home, when I heard at Atlanta of the com-
ing of forty passengers direct from Jacksonville,
and of the godsend of the conference next day at
Augusta.
I have entire confidence in the quarantine no in force in South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabam and Tennessee, and in all Georgia, save Atlanta The State statutes, county and municipal regula-
tions, are of course matters of public record, an may be easily studied. If they are defective any-
wise in their texts, they are tolerably sound i practice (?) to meet the present emergency Your letter addressed to nie at Waycross—als telegram to the same place-—did not catch m there. The letter followed me to Chattanooga,
but the telegram, notwithstanding my instruction to forward, was not delivered. Your message, ad-
dressed to me at Atlanta, was received while I wa on the train for Augusta. I believe I have don all that was necessary to carry out in spirit you letter of instructions, and really consider it ver fortunate that I missed your communications b letter and telegraph, if, in obeying them, I shoul have missed the conference at Augusta, for it wil never be known generally how near a negativ and fruitless result was escaped Finally, let me congratulate the State Board of
Health of Tennessee on the success of its intelli-
gent labors. In none of the sister States is ther to be found a wiser or more economical adminis-
tration of the public health service. Your intel-
ligent, careful work is recognized by every Stat in the Union, and it deserves far more liberal sup-
port by the State Legislature than it has yet re-
ceived. Thus far the special energies of the boar in preventing the extension of yellow fever to this
State have been worth millions of dollars to it citizens; and if the season shall pass without  case of the disease in Tennessee all classes of peo-
ple may thank the State Board of Health for thei escape. With this report I consider the duties o my commission from the board to have been ac-
complished; and if, by the personal sacrifice I
made to accept your agency, I have contribute by my service to the success of the work of vou department, and through it to the welfare of th people of my adopted State, all is well. Here-
with find statement of my necessary expenses an accompanying vouchers Your obedient servant,

New York city, via Atlanta, Montgomery and
New Orleans, traveling without a certificate, wa reported by Inspector Mahon on the Mississippi
& Tennessee Railroad, and was furnished with  certificate. Rumor as to Birmingham is false Except as above, the inspectors report everythin satisfactory to-day. The suspicious case at Gal-
loway was one of malarial hematuria. Part from Coahoma county, Mississippi; had not bee to Florida. When I boarded the train returning,
Inspector Delany, the inspector, said that th alarm was at Mason, a few ni'les north of Gallo-
way. I wrote to Dr. J. J. Elcan, at Mason, to lear the facts, hoping to hear from him by the 13th Dr. Thornton, President City Board of Health,
and I are satisfied that the rumor originated fro the case at Galloway, the sick man being fou miles east of Galloway and about five miles south-
east of Mason. Said sick man is at the house o his father-in-law, Mr. Porter, whose son has re-
covered from an attack of malarial (typho-ma-
larial so called) fever, with which he was stricke the day he got home from Tampa, Fla., about the
19th ult. He bad had a malarial attack befor leaving Florida, became alarmed at the yello fever and made the trip in such a feeble conditio as to induce a relapse. Will inform you of Dr Elcan's report."

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLE1IN Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "While sittin in the telegraph office at the depot this morning,
awaiting the arrival of the train due here at 4:37
a. m., a message passed over the wires sayin there was a case of yellow fever at Decatur. Th operator reported it to me, and I immediatel wired the Mayor of Decatur, and at noon receive a telegram saying that the patient died of ureami poisoning. I have instructed my inspectors, a directed by you in telegram received at 10
a. m. to-day, to allow no Decatur people t stop in this city until further orders. To-day,
upon the arrival of the East Tennessee, Vir-
ginia & Georgia railroad train that reache here at 5:40 a. m., my inspector reported th following refugees to me: W. I. Walker am wife, from Camp Perry, en route to Chicago;
Miss Winnie Walker, age 13, from Camp Perry,
en route to Chicago. The baggage belonging t them had been fumigated. These parties ha been in Florida (Camp Perry) within the las fifteen days, and had stopped over in Cleveland Inspector Brown granted them certificates, and o the strength of that my inspector allowed the to enter this city and change cars here. Trave on the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia rail-
road (main line) has been so heavy for the pas few days that it has been almost impossible fo one man to work the train, consequently I put a extra inspector on that train to-day. The 11:40
p. m. train on the Western & Atlantic Railroa has just arrived, and the inspector reports that  large party of refugees will be on the next train.
I go to Dalton to assist the inspector on tha train, and will return at 4:37 a. m. The Memphis
& Charleston Railroad train, due here at 9:50 p.m.,
is late, and I will report it to-morrow."
Pulaski — Inspector Abernathy: "Since las report no refugees have passed over my line. O the early train this morning I received intelli-
gence that a man had died in Decatur on las night at 9 o'clock, and that he had some symp-
toms of yellow fever, also that a man from Jack-
sonville, Fla., had stayed all night with hi in Decatur about two weeks ago. This informatio aroused some suspicion in my mind, and I boarde the 10:30 a. m. train for Decatur, arriving'there at
12:30 p. m. I found the town panicked, and sev-
eral people took the first trains out. As soon as I
arrived in Decatur I went immediately to Dr Cross'office (who is the health officer of Decatur),
and was consulting physician to the man that died The facts, as ascertained from Dr. Cross, are a follows: On the 17th day of August a Mr. Law-
rence came to Decatur and represented that h came from Atlanta. He stopped with an ac-
quaintance and friend, by the name of A. D Spencer. Subsequent investigation disclosed th fact that he had come from Jacksonville, Fla., di-
rect, so the corporate authorities forced Mr. Law-
rence to leave Decatur. While there he slept i the same room with Mr. A. D. Spencer. Afte leaving Decatur, Lawrence wrote to Spencer from
Kansas City that he was well, and, was a fe days ago, when he was again heard from. On
September 6th A. D. Spencer was taken ill, wit the following symptoms, as I gathered them from
Drs. Bowman and Cross, who attended him: Dys-
enteric discharges from his bowels, which Dr Bowman thought hemorrhoidal, sick stomach,
which was non-retentive of food and medicine al through the sickness until time of death. Th man did not have a high temperature, it register-
ing only 101 degrees Fah. the highest. The doc-
tors represent symptoms of great prostration fo three days before death, and 24 hours before deat there was a total suppression of urine, and befor death the man was comatose, and died after hav-
ing several convulsions. His stomach rejecte everything put upon it, and a few hours befor death he ejected from the stomach a discolore matter very much like black vomit. However, i is proper to mention that he was given, a whil before vomiting this matter, blackberry brandy,
and this may have discolored the vomit. Ther was a jaundiced condition of his skin and con-
junctiva;; but Dr. Cross, who took charge of th corpse, said, after death, the yellow hue of th skin diminished. This case was either yello fever or a bilious remittent of a malignant type As to which of the two, with the lights before me,
I am unable to determine. However, I inclin to the opinion that it is of malarial origin. Dr Cochran, of the State Board of Health of Ala-
bama, came to Decatur this afternoon, also Dr Dozier, of Birmingham, and Dr. Dement, of
Huntsville, Ala , to investigate the matter. I
shall go there to-morrow to make further investi-
gation. After the death of the man Dr. Cros had everything in the way of bedding and wear-
ing apparel in the room burned, and the roo most thoroughly fumigated. The wife and chil-
dren were sent to Huntsville, Ala., this afternoon One of the children was taken with fever on las evening, hut was much better this morning. Wan of time prevents me from giving a more detaile and correct account of this case, but I will get al the information on to-morrow's visit, and will b able to come to a more definite conclusion as t the true nature of this case. While the prepon-
derance of symptoms would argue against yello fever, this case is not without suspicion."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No ref-
ugees to report to-day. I received your dispatc upon reaching the Junction at 6. p. m. I had al-
ready anticipated it, having heard of the suppose case (at Corinth, Miss.) Twelve physicians makin the post mortem, and eight to four against yello fever I am inclined to believe it is a false alarm,
since it was a citizen of the place, not a refugee Dr. Thornton goes up to-day to investigate th matter, as per your request."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees from
Florida points to-day."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No unfavorabl reports to-day from train inspectors. Two trunk are held up, as shown by report of Inspector De-
laney, on Louisville & Naslfville railroad. The were checked from Chattanooga, and there was n one on the train with tickets to correspond."
September 13th Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "Dalton train
3:50, J. C. Tyier, left Palatka, Fla., Sept. 10, for
Chicago. Baggage not fumigated. Had certifi-
cate from health officer Putnam county; age, 55;
white; appeared all right; I gave him a certifi-
cate. Dalton train 3:50, W. S. Walker, wife an daughter Winnie, left Camp Perry, Fla., Sept. 11,

United States physician at the camp; certificat also for baggage from United States officer at
Waycross. 1 always persuade refugees to go by
Kooxrille instead of Chattanooga when I can Thin is the first person I could not influence. I
would have been more persistent had not the
Chattanooga train been under inspection."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "LaBt night,
upon the arrival of the Memphis & Charleston
Railroad train, my inspector reported that h had put off fifteen Decatur people at the tow of Stevenson, Alabama. Thinking that thes people would attempt to enter the city via the
Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railroad I im-
mediately sent a man to Cravens to intercep them. When the Nashville train entered th depot officers boarded each coach and would le nobody out until I inspected the train. I discov-
ered six Decatur people and put them on the
Western & Atlantic Railroad train and sent the through to Atlanta. To-day the inspector on the
Memphis & Charleston Railroad put oft' five De-
caturites at Carpenter's Station, Ala., one o whom had a hard chill. Later on I received  telegram from the Memphis & Charleston Rail-
road's passenger agent asking if these peopl would be allowed to pass through Chattanooga e route to Asheville, N. C. I wired they could no enter this city. All trains have been ordered t pass Decatur without stopping. No boats ply be-
tween this city and Decatur at present. To-day I
put three inspectors on the Nashville road and in-
structed them to stop all Decatur passengers. I
have also placed two extra inspectors on the Mem-
phis & Charleston Railroad. Inspecting the Nash-
ville road gives me five more trains to meet, thu keeping me up at all hours of the day and night.
I doubt very much whether I will be able to en-
dure the loss of rest, but I will try. I went to
Dalton last night expecting to find some Florid refugees, but found none."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "I found o to-day's trains R. H. Lukenbill, aged 21, white,
and J. R. Hawkins, white, aged 35, from Fer-
nandina, Fla. They both had certificates prop-
erly signed, and were destined for Cincinnati, O Issued State Board of Health certificate to each Also found E. L. Green, from Milton, Fla., wh also had a certificate; issued him our certifi-
cate; his age was 17; destination, Lexington,
Va. All is confusion below now. Since th announcement of Dr. Cochran, that Spence died of yellow fever, Decatur has been mor panicked than ever, and last night a larg number of people left on the trains out. To-da no trains have been allowed to stop in Decatur o the Louisville & Nashville line. Still some hav gotten out of Decatur and taken trains from sta-
tions near Decatur. Maj. Geddes, Superintendent,
has arranged a 'terminal' at Harris Station,  few miles north of Decatur, and changing of en-
gines will take place there instead of at Decatur Now, no train is allowed to Btop at Decatur o this line, and this will be kept up so long as ther is any danger. Athens, Ala., will put on a rigi quarantine against Decatur to-night at 0 o'clock,
and I am informed that several other Alabam towns near there have already done so. I did no go to Decatur to-day, as I anticipated, because 1
learned from the conductor of the train that h had orders not to stop his train in Decatur, so I
could not get off. I learn that an autopsy wa had on the remains of Spencer and that fourtee physicians were present. After hearing a state-
ment of the history of the case and the autopsy  vote was taken, nine being of the opinion that i was not yellow fever and five voting that it was Among the latter number was Jerome Cochran,
M. D., State Health Officer of Alabama, whoB opinion has already been published."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees to report to-day, either from Florida or Deca-
tur, Ala."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees foun on trains since last report. On Mobile & Ohi train from the South found S. W. Day, white, age
"8, from Atlanta, Ga., going to St. Louis. No cer-
tificate."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No suspicious per-
sons, baggage nor freight have been reported b train inspectors to-day. The baggage checke from Chattanooga and held up here for investiga-
tion of owner was called for to-day. The partie had certificate from Inspector Lynch."
September 14th Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "Dalton train,
3:50 a. m., Mrs. Cuting, aged 45, and son, aged 16,
left Orlando, Fla., Sept. 10, for Chicago, 111., hav-
ing certificates from the Mayor of Orlando. Thei baggage was sent from Live Oak on the 12th, wit certificate. Emma Key, aged 35, Eustis,Fla.,on the

Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "My inspect-
or on the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia
Railroad (main line) reports that he put off at
Sherman Heights a man named Anogest, wh could not give a satisfactory account of himself;
thiB man claimed to be from Macon, Ga., but th inspector had reason to believe that he was from
McClenny, Fla.; he boarded the Cincinnati trai at Boyce for Mansfield, O. The inspector on the
Memphis & Charleston Railroad reports that h put off at Wauhatchie H. A. Sparrow, aged 53,
from Decatur, Ala. This man came by boat from
Decatur to Bridgeport, and boarded the train a the last named station. A boat is expected t reach here next Sunday from Decatur. I tele-
graphed its Captain that it would not be allowe to land here. I shall watch it and see that it doe not land at this city. I am exercising the greates vigilance and hope to keep refugees away fro here."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "No refugee from Florida up to this hour. The people wh left Decatur on the 2:30 morning train were prin-
cipally Northern people going through the State."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Befor reaching the Junction this evening I discovered
Mrs. T. H. McKinzey and three children from De-
catur, armed with certificate of physicians at De-
catur and Coastland, Ala., bearing date Sept. 13 Their home is Senatobia, Miss. I stopped the here to take the train for Grenada, Miss., which

they did, I refusing to let them on the Memphi train. Her husband is still at Decatur and wil try to make his way out in a day or two. The ar-
ticle in to-day's Memphis Appeal relative to a
Memphian passing all the inspectors, if intende to include me, I denounce, for none escape me,
unless they are vouched for by some one known t me, or who has proved himself all right. I tak no certificate as conclusive proof of where the have been for past ten or twelve days. Supt. Pe-
gram, conductors and quite a number of Memph-
ians will vouch for the rigid examination I giv them."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees from
Florida have passed on any train since last report On a Mobile & Ohio train yesterday evening I
found Mr. C. L. Hall, white, aged 40 years, from
Chattanooga, going to St. Louis; also Mrs. J. W Riley, white, age 35, and two children, 10 and 12
years, from Montgomery, Ala, with tickets to St Louis, Mo."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Train inspector report nothing unfavorable or suspicious to-day,
unless the following report of Inspector Delaney,
on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, be so con-
sidered: 'I arrived here from Milan at 5:15 a. m.
I have no suspicion whatever that anybody was o the train from Florida or Decatur, Ala. I ques-
tioned all the passengers very closely. I examine baggage reports and conductor's tickets, one o which was marked 'Florida Southern Railroad.'
The owner, a sleeping-car passenger and a travel-
ing man, was willing to swear he bought the ticke at Nashville from a scalper. He was very posi-
tive in his statements. I feel confident all waasat-
isfactory.'"
September 15th Cleveland—Inspector Erown: "Dalton train,
3:50 a. m., W. C. Bryant, left Palatka, Fla., Sept.
12, age 35, white, destination Brooklyn, N. Y Has certificate from Palatka Board of Health, als the Mayor—U. S. M. H. S. certificate for baggage.
I gave certificate. The 12:05 train missed connec-
tion; no Florida passengers. Dalton train, 12:05
p. m., had on board J. P. Ellinger, who left Or-
lando, Fla , on Sept. 13th, for Baltimore, Md.;
white, age 42; had certificate from local Board of
Health and U. S. M. H. S. certificate for baggage;
gave him certificate. Dalton train, 3:50 a. m., H.
P. Williams, left Jacksonville, Fla., August 30th,
white, age 29, about 5 feet 7 inches in height; hai and eyes black; present destination Nashville,
Tenn.; baggage not disinfected, and had no cer-
tificate. This man has a certificate from Atlanta,
which city lie left about 36 hours since, but ha none from Florida. I can certify that Mr. Will-
iams was on east-bound train No. 16 on about the
30th or 31st of last month, en route from Jackson-
ville to Louisville, Ky., as you will find by my re-
port of that date."
Chattanooga—Ins|>ector Lynch: "No refugee to report to-night. It is reported here to-day tha a suspicious case exists at Wildwood, Ga., a statio on the Alabama Great Southern Railroad. I g there to-morrow to investigate it. I am enforcin the quarantine against Decatur, but as the trains d not stop there, very few Decatur people come thi way. 1 have telegraphed that no steamboat from Decatur would be allowed to land here."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Received  telegram this 8 a. m., that no new c:i9e of feve had developed in Decatur, from the State Healt officer, Cochran, and things are quieting dow very much there. About 2,000 people have lef the town. A coach filled with people from Dec tur passed up the road yesterday afternoon. I
did not know of this until after the train ha started from Decatur. Several had certificate from Health Officer Cross, but others did not pro-
cure them, as they did not have the time. Al claimed that they had no ex(>osure to the man
Spencer, and many of them I know, and coul trust their statements. Below 1 furnish the name of those from Decatur who stopped in Tennessee:
Lewis Taylor, colored, age 40, destination Bed-
ford's Station; Mrs. J. J. West and children,
white, age 32, Nashville; Mrs. Martha Mershon,
white, 40, Nashville; B. B. Adams, white, 29,
Nashville; F. Pollard, white, 25, Nashville; Katie
Jackson and child, colored, 20 and 1, Columbia;
J. G. Cross, wife and child, white, 30 and 28,
Nashville; Bridget Maxwell, white, 17, Nashville;
Bob Lacroix, white, 13, Nashville; George Fin-
ney, white, 27, Nashville. From Florida the fol-
lowing passengers: Mrs. Anna Sexaul, age 40,
white, destination I-ouisville; Mrs. J. F. Kwin and son, white, ages 48 and 10, from Orange City,
Fla., destination Chicago. All had certificates Since writing this morning I went down to Harris'
Station, intending to go into Decatur, but after ar-
riving there I found no transportation over. Dr Cochran was there (Harris'), having come to estab-
lish a fumigating station at that point. All mail are brought out of Decatur to Harris', and ther fumigated. Dr. Cochran is hopeful over the situa-
tion at Decatur, and stated to me emphaticall that there was no other new cases in Decatur The fact that no new cases have been develope as yet from Spencer, four days having elapse since his death, is encouraging to say the least Ten days will, more than likely, decide the ques-
tion as to the spread of the disease, and four o these days have passed. In interviewing Dr Cochran as to those who were directly exposed t the sick man Spencer, he said about twenty-on persons came in actual contact with Spencer, an ten others, indirectly, were exposed. Those wh were directly exposed have been put under a rigi quarantine, and will not be allowed to leave De-
catur until all danger of an outbreak of th disease in them is positively decided These people being under the observation of
Dr. Cochran and Health Officer Cross, an quarantined from outside communication, I
think people may leave Decatur without dange of spreading the disease; so I have allowe a nnml>er of people from Decatur to come into
Tennessee. Health Officer Cross issued certificate to people on yesterday, but he now tells them tha it is unnecessary to have them, as all persons ex-
posed are under watch and quarantine. From
Florida I found to-day Willis Pulling, white,
age 41, from Madison county, Fla., destination
Cincinnati; James H. Lesby, white, age 30,
from Sumpter county, Fla., destination Scot-
land; D. fi. Kimmel, wife and two children,
ages 34, 29, 4 and 3, from Sparr, Fla., destination
Waterville, Kas.; J. V. Fairhead, white, age 39,
from Middleberg, Fla., destination Utica, N. Y.

Mr. Fairhead left Jacksonville on the 6th of Aug-
ust and came to Middleberg, and has been ther since. He had certificates stating these facts, an that he was from Middleberg. However, I am in-
clined to regard him with some suspicion. As h was passing through the State I let him go on All the above-named parties had certificates prop-
erly sealed and signed. Mayor W. D. Chipley' wife and children, from Pensacola, were on th train en route for Cincinnati."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Passe to Memphis to day R. W. Ellis, white, age 24,
from Citro. Marion county, Fla., who left Florida
August 1st, and has been in luka, Miss., for th past four weeks. No refugees encountered to-day Passed Memphians hailing from Courtland, and
Florence, Ala., and luka, Miss. All were pro-
vided with certificates and vouchers fully authen-
ticated. I could not inspect No. 1 train this a.m.,
as it was seven hours late. However, I got the
Memphis officer to go up with me until we met it,
and he inspected it."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "Found on Mobile
& Ohio train, 4:30 p. m., north-bound, yesterday,
Mr. John Ward, white, age 25, from Pensacola to
Chicago; no certificate. To-day on 11:30 a. m.

Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No person or bag-
gage reported from infected or suspicious localitie to-day by train inspectors, except Inspector Mahon,
inspector on Mississippi & Tennessee Railroad, re-
ports one family of refugees from Decatur, named
McEenzie, got off the train at Conio, Miss. Also

companied him, and had like certificates."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch . "I intended t go to Wildwood.Ga,this morning lo investigate th caae that I reported to you last night, but just be-
fore leaving a telegram was received announcin the patient's death, and I did not go. The patien was a man named Wilson, who came to Wild woo from Decatur a few days ago. The case look rather suspicious. I have no other cases to repor to-night. Travel on all lines is unusually light The detention stations at Boyce and Sherman
Heights have heen removed to Citico, just beyon the city limits. This move was made by the Chat-
tanooga Board of Health in order to satisfy th citizens of Boyce and Sherman Heights, who pro-
tested vigorously against the detention of refugee at these points."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "On to-day' trains I only found Geo. Lardner, white, age 29,
residence River Junction, Fla., destination Louis-
ville, Ky. Certificate sealed and signed properly;
issued State Board of Health certificate to him In the baggage car I found a trunk from Waldo,
Fla., checked to Cincinnati, O. This piece of bag-
gage came over the 1 Fla Railway & Navigation
Co.'9 road. It must have come to Baldwin an through McClenny to River Junction. It had a Fla Railway & Navigation road check, and the prob-
lem with me was how it got through. I inspecte the train from baggage car to sleeper, and wit the aid of conductor and baggage-master was una-
ble to find the owner. Perhaps he was put off. I
did not know whether or not it had been fumigated,
as no owner was found, and as it was goin through the State let it pass on. There are no ne developments at Decatur as yet, and the excite-
ment is subsiding. Athens, I am informed by May-
or Lane, will raise her quarantine to-day."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees encountered to-day. The Decatur and Bir-
mingham alarm has about subsided; nevertheless
I think it of vital import to be extremely watch-
ful until all danger is past—rather until frost."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "On Mobile & Ohio
Railroad north-bound yesterday found Mr. John
Milne, white, age 17, from Chattanooga, through
Decatur, to Eddyville, Ky. Had certificate from

ing of importance to report to-day. Mr. Theo. A Melter, of Jacksonville, Fla., came in on the Nash-
ville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railroad train to-
night at 9:50. lie claims to have left Jacksonvill thirty days ago. He has been in Atlanta and
Nashville for the past fifteen days, and having sat-
isfactory evidence that what he said was true, I
passed him. I placed a man at Wauhatchie to-
day to look after any refugees that may be detaine there."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees to-day to report. I met Inspector Jordan, of
Milan, at Corinth, Miss., to-day. Telegraph oper-

been passed by the inspectors back of him on  health certificate as R. G. Sharpe and wife, an that they were from Decatur, Ala. This informa-

Daly, on Louisville & Nashville Railroad, arrive at 4 p. m., reporting two pieces of baggage from
Waldo, Fla., destined for Kansas. They wer checked Nos. 1255 and 970, and were put off at
Arlington to be shipped back, having been ordere over Kansas City Railroad. Inspector Tidwell,
on Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railroad, re-
ports a tramp named John Grafl, from New Or-
leans and Vicksburg, traveling without health cer-
tificate. Graff told me he left New Orleans ove two months ago, worked at and near Vicksburg,
leaving there over two weeks ago, and was tryin to get back to Kentucky, his home."
September 18th Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On the Dalto train, 3:50a. m., was F. B. Favor, white, age40,hai and eyes black, height 5 feet 9 inches, from Lake

City. Had certificate from President Board of
Health of Pensacola, and baggage certificate from
U. S. officers at Live Oak. Issued certificates t the above parties. I am running on two nigh and one day train at present, so that I may assis in maintaining the Chattanooga quarantine."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch : "T have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. Travel from Florid has been unusually light for the past few days. I
was very much surprised to-night to find no in-
spector on the Nashville train that reaches thi city 9:50 p. m. Upon investigation I found tha the trains passed at Bolivar instead of Stevenson,
as usual. I immediately hunted up the conductor,
and he reports that most, of the passengers wer from Nashville."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "No ref-
ugees to-day. I continue to run up to Corinth,
Miss., every day. It enables me to make rigi examination without delaying the trains."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "Two pieces of bag-
gage from Waldo, Fla., checked to Emporia, Kas ,
passed south on the Illinois Central Railroad yes-
terday, via Grenada, Miss., thence to Memphis,

tion. It had not been fumigated, so far as known On the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, yesterday, found
Mr. J. A. Davis, white, age 45, from Macon, Ga.,

from evidence, that he had not been exposed t yellow fever."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Inspector Perry,
on Memphis & Charleston Railroad, reported yes-
terday Mr. A. G. Shuford, from Gainesville, Ga.,
traveling with health certificate. I learned to-da that it was a mistake, and that Mr. Shuford wa from Gainesville, Fla. I found him with certifi-
cate from clerk of court, and from Marine Hos-
pital Surgeon at Waycross, both dated 15th inst He resides ten miles south of Gainesville, an was in that town only about two hours awaitin train. I did not regard him dangerous, but Dr Thornton, President of the City Board of Health,
thought differently, and has ordered his departur to-night. Mr. Shuford told me he would go fro here to Murfreesboro, Tenn., if he did not suc-
ceed in buying mules here, and that he expecte to leave to-night or to-morrow. Inspector Pen-y als reports Mr. W. B. Wright and wife, of Decatur,
Ala , arriving here to-day on health certificate of
Dr. Lowry, of Huntsville, obtaining it there an paving one dollar for it. Mr. W. and wife wer ordered to leave to-night. With the above excep-
tions, nothing worthy of mention has been re-
ported to me. I had notice from Inspector Jordan,
at Milan, of the transit back of trunks alluded t in my report of 17th. Dr. Thornton, Presiden of the City Board of Health, informs me that Mr Shuford will leave to-night on the 10 p. m. trai for Murfreesboro, over the Louisville & Nashville
Railroad."
September 19th Cleveland — Inspector Brown: "On Dalto train, 3:50 a. m., was Wm. Center, white, age 45,
from Starke, Bradford county, Fla., destined for
Washington, D. C. Had certificate from the U.
8. officer at Live Oak. He appears to be all right He is a resident of Washington. Dalton train,
12:05, had on board S. E. Layne, white, age 25,

September 16th, for Knoxville, Tenn.; had cer-
tificate from the Mayor and Board of Health, an one from the Live Oak authorities regarding bag-
gage. I have been informed that some Jackson-
ville refugees (without certificates) already re-
ported, had passed the guard and escaped th quarantine at Camp Perry."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "Train in-
spectors report that with the following exceptio they have encountered no refugees to-day: In-
spector on the Memphis & CharUston Railroa to-day put off at Bridgeport, Ala., O. Holder,
from Decatur, Ala., age 23, height 5feet 10 inches;
soft brown complexion, light hair and mustache At time he was put off he wore a black frock coa and light pants. Travel from the South has bee unusually light for the past 24 hours."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "On yesterday
I found on the trains from Florida, H. C. Bailey,
colored, age 35, from Leon county, Fla , destina-
tion Nashville, Tenn. He had certificates signe and sealed properly; issued him ours. From De-
catur, I found Geo. McCoy, age 21, white. H was going to Nashville. On asking him if he wa exposed to Spencer or Kibby, he said that h was afraid of them, and had not been near them He had no certificate, and further said that th doctor told him it was unnecessary to procur one. I let him pass, believing that he told m the truth as to exposure to the men who died. I
also found from Decatur, A. A. Lischenberger,
white, age 24, destination Mt. Vernon, Ind.; H.
W. Howard, wife and son, white, ages 43, 40 and
10 respectively; had certificates from Dr. Cross Destination Cincinnati, Ohio. Since the death of
O. O. Kibby, of suspected yellow fever, and th reported case, at Wauhatchie, the excitement is in-
creasing, especially in Limestone county, whic has quarantined rigidly against Decatur. The

railroad agent at Pulaski has orders not to sel tickets to any point below Athens. The rumo being prevalent this morning that the nurse wh waited on Kibby had sickened and died last night,
I telegraphed to 15. F. Cross to wire me the fact in the case, and received the following: "Kibby' nurse is not sick. No suspicious symptoms." So I
take it there are no new developments since
Kibby's death, which I am informed by the ver highest authority was caused by yellow fever. Th telegram of Dr. Cross induces me to the belie that Decatur has not aR yet become an infecte point, and I hope for the best. Being unable t go further South than Athens, I must rely on th telegraph lines for information. However, I wil do my best to keep you informed of any new de-
velopments there. I wired Dr. Cross that I woul nut pass into our State any other person from
Decatur who did not have a certificate fro him a* Health Officer, that they had not been ex-
posed to Spencer or Kibby. At M o'clock p. m Inspector Abernatliy wrote the following: "I hav just received a telegram from Jerome Cochran,
State Health Officer of Alabama, now tit Decatur,
in response to my telegram to Health Officer
Cross, of Decatur, which is as follows: 'Kibby' nnrse has not been sick. We have one case unde observation.' I take it that this is very ominous Another case in Decatur after the two alread there, would look very much like an infected cen-
ter. I found on the train this afternoon, J. M Tarble and wife, white, ages 54 and 25, from Pen-
sacola, Fla., destination Chicago, III.; had certifi-
cates; issued ours to them. Also from near De-
catur, Henry Westtrfall, wife and infant, white,
atres 25 and 21 years and 7 months respectively They had no certificates, and as they were goin through the State I let them pass on. Their des-
tination was Greenville, Ohio. Will wire you i anything alarming occurs at Decatur."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: l: No ref-
ugees to-day. I find it necessary to even go be-
hind the seats in the cars for refugees. It is  mortifying confession that men will lend their in-
fluence in thus practicing deception. No longe than yesterday a man had a certificate certifyin that he had been in town two months, to his knowl-
edge, and I found out, by papers in his possession,
lie had been there only four weeks."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "On 11:30 a. m.

phis, I found J. T. Cross and wife and daughter,
white, ages 35, 25 and 5 years, from Decatur, Ala.;
had certificates signed by Dr. Cross, Health Offi-
cer at Decatur, Ala. Had tickets and baggag checked from Nashville to Humboldt, Tenn After receiving your dispatch, having previousl notified them, I told them they must leave to-day,
which they have done, Mr. Cross returning to De-
catur, hia wife and daughter going to Kentucky."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Inspector Daly,
on Louisville & Nashville Railroad, reports tw men as suspicious on his train this afternoon. Th men were railroad laborers from Cairo, III., goin to Lei and, Miss. Inspector Jordan left word thi morning for Inspector Daly, at Milan, that one o them was from Florida (Jacksonville). Both me claimed a case of mistaken identity. They wer eent under surveillance to depot on way to Leland With this exception, nothing suspicious has bee reported to me to-day."

Refugee from Decatur, Ala., put off here by
Chattanooga quarantine officer last week, die with black vomit at Wildwood,Ga.,last night, thre miles from here and nine from Chattanooga. At-
tending physician telegraphed Mayor Nicklin, of
Chattanooga, for physician to examine the case Mayor Nicklin would have nothing to do with it People here are excited and condemn Chattanoog officials in strong terms for thrusting refugees fro infected districts on a small village and then re-
fusing to send physician when a case of yellow fe-
ver develops. Excitement is very high, and threat of violence are freely made if it is not stopped a once. Can you do anything for us in the way o suggesting a course to pursue? Answer quick Signed: J. H. Light, J. P., S. E Rowden, P. M.,
James Way, J. C. Rowden, Agent, Frank Smith,

J. D. Ptunket, MI)., President State Board of Health,
Ha»hiille, Tenn.:
Sir—In obedience to the commission from vou honorable Board of Health, dated Sept 17th, 1888,
directing me to proceed at once to Wildwood,  station on the Alabama Great Southern Railroad,
in Dade county, Ga., and investigate the circum-
stances attending the recent death of Fleming
Wilson at that place, and if possible determin the nature of his disease, I have the honor to re-
port that, taking the first train I arrived at Wau-
hatchie about 9:30 o'clock that night, and was cor-
dially received by Dr. S. R. Deakins and othe prominent citizens of Wanhatchie and vicinity About midnight Dr. Lynch, the State Inspector at
Chattanooga, called to see me. Early the nex morning I went over to Wildwood, three or fou miles distant, and carefully examined into all th facts and circumstances relative to the illness an death of Mr. Wilson, returned to Wanhatchi about noon and briefly communicated with yo by telegraph, and returned to Nashville by "th evening train. The facts obtained are briefly a follows: Mr. Fleming Wilson had been living an working in Decatur, Ala., for some months past,
hiswife remaining in Chattanooga. It is suppose that Wilson on being taken sick at Decatur mad an effort to reach his wife; at any rate he was pu off the train at Stevenson, Ala , about 8 p. m., on
Wednesday night, the 12th inst., by the Chatta-
nooga train inspectors, and he remained on th platform all night. The next morning (Thurs-
day; he boarded a train going in the direction of
Chattanooga, and was again put off the train at
Carpenter's station by the same inspectors. A fe hours later he boarded another train snd was p off about noon by the seme inspectois at Wan

hatchie, where lie remained about two hours,
when he was placed in a wagon and taken to rela-
tiveH at Wildwood. That night Dr. Dcakins wa called to nee him, and attended him professionall until his death on Saturday night.following (the
15th inst.) He was buried the afternoon of th following day. The Doctor soon realized the fac that he had in Mr. Wilson a very suspicions case,
if not positive yellow fever. After refreshing hi memory a little about a case of yellow fever h treated some years since and com paring symptoms,
he was not long in deciding that Mr. Wilson ba yellow fever. After a careful analysis of Mr. Wil-
son's symptoms, as given by this clear-headed an experienced physician, including suppression o urine and black vomit during the last six hours o life, together with the general appearance of hi patient before and after death. I unhesitatingl express the opinion that Mr. Wilson died of yel-
low fever. Mr. Wilson stated before leaving
Wauhalchie that he had fever when ejected fro the train at Stevenson, and Dr. Dcukins says ther was no intermission in his fever during his illness About a dozen persons were exposed to the conta-
gion during Wilson's illness. All measures of iso-
lation, disinfection, burning of infected bedding,
clothing, etc., deemed necessary, have been take and ordered, and will be carried out by Dr. Dea-
kins as fully as possible. I found the people of
Wauhatchie and Wildwood and vicinity very muc excited and indignant at the train inspectors fo putting off yellow fever victims among them, a they are wholly unprepared to receive and care fo these unfortunates without direct contact wit their own families, and fresh victims in their ow households. As suggested in my telegram to you,
and in my conversation with Dr. Lynch, a statio should be established and maintained west of Chat-
tanooga, where all suspected persons can be sen and detained the usual time, making them as com-
fortable as possible. In conclusion, I expres heartiest thanks to these good people for their hos-
pitable and generous treatment of myself; and t you, Doctor, who responded so promptly to thei petition for help, their gratitude knows no bounds.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
*H. Shannon, M.D Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 19, 1888 September 20th The bringing, by the government direct from
Jacksonville, Fla., several hundred refugees to
Hendersonville, N. C, among whom there devel-
oped several cases of yellow fever, made it nec-
essary to have the avenues into Tennessee fro that locality guarded, especially as these refugee were disposed to scatter over the country at will To that end Dr. E. J. Peck was appointed on Sep-
tember 17th, State Inspector, with headquarters at
Newport, near State line, upon branch road of
E. T., Va. & Ga. Kailroad, which runs from Mor-
riatown, Tenn., to Asbeville, N. C Newport—Inspector Peck: "No Florida refu-
gees have come into Tennessee from North Caro-
lina since my appointment as inspector. I inclos copy of letter in answer to inquiries from Hender-
sonville, N. C. The worst trouble to be appre-
hended is, that most of the refugees at Henderson-
ville are negroes without money, and there ar agents for Tennessee railroads there now get-
ting up hands to work on new roads in this State.
I feel an effort will be made to bring the Florid negroes here, and they will be very difficult t detect, but I will use every effort to prevent it Yours of the 19th received, also the necessar blanks. I have been clothed with power to ad-
minister oath as instructed. There are doubl daily trains running here from Asheville an points east of there, and as the schedules are ar-
ranged now, it is impossible to inspect both train before they reach the State line, unless I can ge permission to go to Hot Springs on freight trains
Nos. 4(5 and 48; this would overcome the diffi-
culty. I wired Mr. C. H. Hudson, Superinten-
dent E T , V. & G. R. R, for this permission, an a few minutes ago received a telegram granting it."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "Da I ton train

Grand J unction—Inspector Prewitt: "No refu-
gees to-day to report. I met a policeman from
Jackson, Tenn., at Corinth, Miss., to-day. The'
news from Decatur now is of an alarming"nature The railroad agent of M. & C. R. R. at tha point had a chill this a.m., and the latest ad-
vises are that he is quite sick. Two nurses of th man Spencer that died are Baid to be very sick Telegraph operator threatens to leave. I rece.ve your letter and shall do the best I can."

Board of Health has ordered stopping trains on
Memphis & Charleston Railroad ten miles out fo further and thorough inspection. I notified Dr.
J. K. Sanford, of Covington, about the Trou case September 21st Upoh September 20th instructions were give the State Inspectors *.o apply same regulations t refugees from Jackson, Miss., as to those from
Decatur and infected points in Florida Newport—Inspector Peck: "Three refugees from
Gainesville, Fla , left there August 11th, and hav been at Alexander, N. O, since August 17th; ha heiltli certificates; none of them sick. Their des-
tination is Terre Haute, Ind , via Knoxville and
Jellieo; held through limited tickets; names,
Philip Miller, male, white, age 37; Mrs. Philip
Miller, white, age 25, and Mrs. A. G. Austin,
white, age 46. I learned from a passenger on th train last night from Hendersonville, N. C, tha of the eight cases of yellow fever among the refu-
gees at that place, two will probably be discharge to-morrow; five are doing well, and one will die Two cases were re|>orted in Asheville yesterday,
but it lacks confirmation. I will notify all th emigrant agents I meet that if they bring thos refugee negroes into this State they will lay them-
selves liable to arrest and punishment."
Cleveland—Ins|>ector Brown : ' On Dalton train,
12:06 p. ra , was Eliza Steven", from Tallahasse,
Fla., which place she left on September 17th for
Washington, D. C ; had certificate from Leon
County B>ard of Health, as also from U. S. officer Mrs. E. K Hollinger, age 30, with infant and nurse
(Mary Clark, colored), from the same city as Miss
Stevens; destination the same, and certificate from same authorities. On the 3:50 a. m. train,
Edgar Thomas, at present from Atlanta, says h was near, but not in Gainesville, Fla., two week xmi, destination Cincinnati, Ohio. I prevailed on
Imn to go via Kuoxville instead of Chattanooga;
had no certificate. Here is his description: White,
age 30, stoutly built, weight 100, height 5 ieet 7 inches, eyes brown, hair blnck, and scarce in quan-
titv, figure stooping slightly, complexion dark,
not very well dressed, dark brown suit. I do no like his appearance and conversation. He says
Gainesville is in Hamilton county, high up in the
State, and no yellow fever exists there"
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "To-day a ca load of refugees were detained at Morganvill until some decision as to their final dispositio could be made. It was decided to let them pas through the city, as they were going direct to Cin-
cinnati, and this p. m. they passed through wit closed doors and an officer on each platform. I
sent an officer some distance up the Cincinnati
•Southern R ulroad with them to see that they di not get off within the State of Tennessee. I di not have time to procure their signatures to th blanks you sent me, as they were here only a fe minute*. Total number in the coach was fifteen,
and they were all from Jackson, Miss."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernalhy: "I have bee so much on the wing for the last two Hays I hav been unable to write you my report of inspection In tbe beginning, let me say it was not from in-
timidation as stated in the papers that refugees wer allowed to enter the State on September 20th When the train had reached State Line, I ha been all through it, and found the parties wh were to stop in Tennessee all with certificate from doctors in Decatur, the majority from State
Health Officer Cochran, that they had not bee exposed to any of the sick of Decatur, and tha they ought to be allowed to pass out. I knew m power to stop the train at State Line was absolute,
but the question came up, if I put these people of here, Limestone county, Ala., which is rigidl quarantined, would eject them and throw the back into Tennessee, and Giles county had n guard at Stale Line to keep them out. Also man of them had not money to pass through the State,
so I deemed it best, after considering the whol question, to let them pass on their health certifi-
cates, with the promise that they would not stop i the cities nor towns, but would go directly throug the Slate. Those who stopped here were sent di-
rectly to Elkmont Springs, a high and healthfu locution, and our people fear nothing from them Those stopping in the State are as follows: Fan-
nie Donnigan, white, age 56, destination Colum-
bia; J. T. Weaver, wife and son, white, ages 56,
45 and 10, destination Campbell's Station; B. E Moore, wile and two children, white, ages 40, 30,
5 and 3, destination Nashville. The Perkin family, consisting of mother and five children,
destination Pulaski, now under observation at Elk-
mont Springs; Henrietta Beford, colored, age 20,
Elkmont Springs, and Lou Bramlet, age 18, des-
tination Pulaski—sent to the country. Put off at
State Line J. N. Chestnut, from Decatur; claime he had not been in Decatur for a week (?), but pu him off any way. From Florida I found A. Perry,
wife and child, white, ages 29, 28 years and 6
months, from Monticello, Fla., destination Chi-
cago, 111.; also, Geo. V. Ott and wife, ages 59 and
30, Irom Leon county, Fla., destination Kansas
City, Mo. They had certificates signed and seale properly; issued ours. I stopped at Prospect, an there learned that a refugee train was coming. I
went back to Stale Line, and there halted it. Al on board were refugees from Decatur, numberin about 150, all of whom had taken an oath an signed an obligation from the Tennessee State
Board of Health to pass directly through the
State and not return until after the existing quar-
antine shall have been raised, except a man an wife who gave his name as Win, Allen, but th conductor said his name was Wash Miller. I tol him he must get off the train or go directl through the State. He drew his knife and de-
clared he would not do cither. I told him h could not go a step further, and he then promise to go through the State. After the train starte he denied the promise, and proposed to stop at
Nashville or Columbia, as opportunity afforded Wired Columbia officials and you at Nnshville This man should be arrested and dealt with to th fullest extent of the law. With the addition o an assistant, the trains can be better inspecte night and day, and I intend that no refugee shal come into the State unless conditions are complie with, if the train must be detained at State Lin indefinitely."
To assist the health authorities of Alabama i depopulating Decatur, the State Board of Health,

Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Memphi has stopped the west bound trsiins nine miles out,
and <!oes not allow them to enter the city. Ten case i>£ yellow fever reported at Decatur, Ala., an eight at Jackson, Miss , created an alarm here, re-
stiltin" in the prevention of passenger trains o the Memphis & Charleston Railroad stopping a this place. Water Valley, Miss , has quarantine against Memphis. People are fleeing from Jack-
s>n, Canton, Water Valley and Grenada, Miss. I
think the Illinois Central Railroad will be refuse permission to stop to-day. T am told that if I ru on the train any m >re I will not be allowed to re-
torn home People in this and other towns ar wild with excitement What shall I do?"
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The extremel panicky condition of our citizens has kept m chiefly occupied in assisting Dr. Thornton, Presi-
dent City Board of Health. About 3 p. m a tele-
phmie message was received at my office in m absence to the effect that a Decatur man ha bisrded the cars at Guthrie, Ky., and got off at

Nashville Railroad. Inspector Mahon, on Mis-

Railroad this morning. The other left this even-
ing for Buffalo or Albany, X. Y., via St. Louis,
over the Iron Mountain Railroad. A report wa given Dr. Thornton that a man reached here ove the Birmingham Railroad this morning or las nislit who had not been inspected or interrogate on train, and that he was from Jacksonville, Fla.
I investigated, and found that he was from near

day."
September 22d The following circular letter was mailed t each of the county and municipal health officers,
and to the individual members of all local healt boards, the mayors and members of all municipa town councils, and others in local authority in the
State: i
Office Statf. Board of Health,
Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 22, 1888 Dear Sir—The development of yellow fever at
IVcatiir, Ala., upon our Southern border, and it disposition to spread at that place, together wit the appearance of the disease at Jackson, Miss.,
on the 20th inst., gives a gravity to the situatio at this writing which health officials (State,
county, and town) must take prompt recognitio of. and bv united effort protect Tennessee agains the possibility of the plague getting a foot-hol nithin our borders. Instructions were issued to
Slate In«j>ectors upon 20th inst. to pass no one
Erom either Decatur or Jackson, unless such per-
lon was going directly through the State withou topping, and, to guard against their returning to
State before it would be prudent for them to do so Each individual is required to subscribe to th allowing oach (if a minor, then by parent o piardian):
"/ herein/ solemnly swear that I will at this tim la-ss directly through the State of Tennessee, an will not return to within the borders of said Stat until after ten days shall have elapsed from thi date, and that I will not go into any portion of Ten-
nessee lying west of Tennessee river, or into an county forming southern border of said State a far east as, and including, Bradley county, unti after the existing quarantine shall have bee raised by the State Board of Health. So help me

State inspectors regarding other points, shoul yellow fever make its appearance elsewhere Now, with the active co-operation of county an town health officials and the local civil authori-
ties in general, in the prompt and rigid enforce-
ment of the order of the State Board of Healt issued upon the. 20th inst, which reads, " Allo no refugee direct from an infected point to stop in
State," no trouble it is believed can arise It i suggested that you scrutinize closely all fresh ar-
rivals in your town and county, and if there ar even good ground for suspicion, give the publi the benefit of the doubt in every case by requir-
ing such "suspects " to leave the State upon firs train. The State Board of Health stands read and willing to give you or your constituenc prompt assistance upon notice, wherever the sam shall become necessary Very respectfully yours,
J. D. Plunket,
President Newport—Inspector Peck : "No Florida refugee came into Tennessee from North Carolina yester-
day."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On the 12:05  ra. Dalton train was Mrs. Lizzie Horton, whit age 35, hair black, eyes dark, medium height,
weight 120 pounds, who left Orlando, Fla., on
Sept. 19th, for New York City. Had certificate from local Board of Health and the Mayor of Or-
lando, and baggage certificate from U. S. officer at
Waycro*s, Ga. The 3:50 train missed souther connection. Considerable excitement and appre-
hension prevails in Cleveland because of the re-
ported spreading of the epidemic in the States ad-
joining Florida."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "Circulars wil be scattered broadcast over the country to notif the'people that Chattanooga has quarantined; ev-
ery train entering the city will be placarded Thi afternoon the Board of Health held another meet-
ing and decided not to allow the Memphis &
Charleston Railroad to run any more trains int the city. The trains on this road will make trans-
fers at Lookout, just this side of Waubatchie Trains on the Alabama Great Southern Railroa will pass around the city on the Belt Railroa without stopping. Every passenger entering th city must hereafter present a health certificate No doubt more stringent measures will be adopte to-morrow, for the excitement here is intense. To-
night the Memphis & Charleston Railroad train

that usually leaves here at 7 o'clock did not go,
and my inspectors could not meet the Nashvill and Memphis trains due here at 9:50 p. m. Wit two officers I got in a carriage and rode to Craven's,
where we held the trains until we had made  thorough inspection. We found no refugees on the
Nashville train, but on the Memphis & Charlesto train the following parties were found: N. A Bost, age 25, destination Slatesville, N. C. H had not been in Decatur for the past twelve days.
J. Leipheimer, age 22, destination Sharon, Tenn.;
his wife accompanied him, and they left Decatu two weeks ago, having been in Trinity, Ala., in th meantime. As these parties had exceeded the te days' limit, I did not have them sign the obliga-
tion."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "There were n refugees on trains to-day coming into and throug this State from Decatur, Ala., Jacksonville, Fla.,
nor Jackson, Miss. The quarantine of Limeston county, Ala., in very effective. The souther boundary of this county is the Tennessee river, an the county has placed guards at every point wher there is a crossing, and have taken charge of th ferries and will allow no one to cross at all. S there is but one outlet, and that is the Louisvill and Nashville Railroad. The bridge over the
Tennessee river is heavily guarded, and if refu-
gees do not get on at points below Decatur, the cannot get out. If this rigid quarantine is main-
tained as it is nowenforced.no refugee will get ou of Decatur in this direction. I learn that in th last twenty-four hours sixteen cases have devel-
oped and there have been two deaths, though thi information is not positive. Should anything ver important come up, will wire yon at once."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "Since the fever ha made its appearance at Jackson, Miss., all town along the line of the Illinois Central Railroad hav quarantined against Jackson, Miss., allowing n north-bound train to stop for any purpose. Mila authorities, against my judgment and opinion,
have quarantined against all the fever infecte points, permitting no train on any road to stop i the limits of her corporation. I told them the
State Board of Health was doing everything neces-
sary to keep the fever out of Tennessee, and wit the help of local Boards would be successful Trains loaded with refugees from Jackson an other towns in Mississippi, pass on all roads go-
ing north twice a day, not being allowed to stop i the State. South of Milan no inspection can b made. Received blank oaths and will administe them without favor to all. I suggested to Supt Clarke yesterday that he run a refugee train dail for them exclusively, and to continue to run hi regular train for other passengers. Owing to quar-
antine it will be difficult to communicate with yo every day. Would be pleased to have any sugges-
tions from you on the present situation. I permi no Decatur, Ala., or Jackson, Miss., to stop in
West Tennessee or the State."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No person or bag-
gage from infected localities reported to-day b train inspectors."
September 23rd Newport—Inspector Peck: "The following i the report of Florida refugees coming into this
State from North Carolina on yesterday: Alice G Castle, female, while, age 26; M. C Castle, male,
white, age 32; Clarence M. Gordon, male, white,
age 26; Phoebe D. Gordon, female, white, nge 23;
Mrs. Addie Lumpkin, female, while, age 47; Geo.
T. Fudger, male, white, age 28; C. G. Erickson,
male, white, age 22; and G. W. Russell, male,
white, age 25. All of these parties held healt certificates signed by the Mayor of Hendersonville,
N. C, and County Physician; also endorsed by
Notary Public with seal. They also had certifi-
cates that bagitsge had been thoroughly fumi-
gated by the United States officials. They wer all going to Kentucky except two, who were goin to Minneapolis, Minn. All of them had straigh limited thkets, and would not stop in Tennessee It is impossible to go to Asheville every day an work both trains, but if you think best I can ar-
range so as to take a freight train and go every othe day. Please advise me in the event of discoverin a refugee this hide of the State line, without healt certificate; shall I send him back into North Caro-
lina'.' I will pursue this course until I hear fro you."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On the 3:50 a.
m. train was Mrs. W. Pettit and daughter, Fannie,
white, age 19, from near Ocala, Marion county,
Fla., destined for Philadelphia, Pa. Had certifi-
cates from Marion county Health Officer, and als baggage certificate from the U. S. officer at Way-
cross, Ga. On the Chattanooga train, which wa one hour and forty minutes late, was W. H. Grif-
fin, who left Lake City, Fla, on Sept. II, for Co-
lumbiana, Ala. Had certificates from local Health
Officer and one for luggage from U S.M. H. S. of-
ficer at Waycross, Ga. The coming of Mr. Grif-
fin created a sensation, due to his statement of hav-
ing been in Jacksonville, Fla. The report reache me in an exaggerated form. I investigated an found that he has not been in Jacksonville for si months. Our city is on the point of establishin local quarantine, to co-operate with State Inspect-
ors. While on the cars this evening, en route for
Rome, Ga., one of our best citizens, C. L. Hard-
wick, with his usual consideration of the publi welfare and abnegation of self, offered to provid one guard at his own expense Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "I have en-
countered no refugees since my last report. Ou city is much quieter than it was yesterday, and th feeling of uneasiness seems to have subsided. Al trains on the Alabama Great Southern Railroa have been discontinued; the mail is carrie through on a locomotive. The telegram publishe in the American this morning saying that seventy -
Bix refugees from Jackson passed through her last night is a mistake ; all of the seventy-six wer from Meridian."
Upon notice from County Board of Health of
Lincoln county, that they would suggest the nam of a physician and pay his expenses, if the State
Board of Health would commission him Inspecto and give him instructions, Dr. W. F. Cronk wa thus appoinled Slate Inspector, upon 2'-'nd Septem-
ber, with headquarters at Elora. The followin is his report for the 23rd:
Elora—Inspector Crunk : " Having been sugges-
ted for appointment as Inspector by the Board of

Health of Lincoln county, and commissioned by
State Board of Health, I have made Elora, Tenn.,
a quarantine station—where the Hnntsville roa intersects the Winchester and Alabama road,  distance of forty-seven miles from Decatur. Fiv refugees, one of whom was very sick, passed her yesterday at 3p.ni., for Nashville. I wired Dr Mitchell, City Health Officer at that place, a once, so that he could take steps to keep them fro stopping there. I will not allow any one to enter
Lincoln county or State without a certificat laving they have not been in a yellow fever dis-
trict."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "In accordanc with your instructions I met the refugee train o last night, not at State Line, as suggested, but at
Athens, Ala., at 5 a. tu.. after having spent a sleep-
less night waiting its approach. There were abou fifty passengeri", all of whom were to pass throug the Slate, and had signed the obligations and take the oath required by the State Board of Health fo refugees to pass through the State. It is ver probable that there were two cases of yellow fever
[Dr. Taylor and Mr. Gatilt] on the last coach o the train, which was locked and no one permitte to enter. I did not go into the coach as it was un-
necessary. My people here are so panicked an terrorized that I have been threatened with quar-
antine myself. There were no refugees on this af-
ternoon's train from any infected point."
On this day another refugee train passe through Tennessee, and, in accordance with th rules of the Tennessee State Board of Health,
permitting them to enter this State for the pur-
pose of passing directly through northwardly, th following parties swore and subscribed to the fol-
lowing oath:
/ hereby solemnly swear that I will, at this time,
pass directly through the State of Tennessee, an will not return to within the borders of said Stat until after ten days shall have elapsed from thi date, and that I will not go into any portion of
Tennessee lying west of Tennessee River, or int any county forming southern border of said Stat as far east as, and including, Bradley county,

September 24th Newport—Inspector Peck: "The following i the report for those that came over from North
Carolina yesterday: Andy Baker, white, male,
age 20, a refugee from Jacksonville, Fla., and a he had no certificate I arrested him and sent hi back into North Carolina; John Luth, white,
male, age 21; Mrs. Maud Holmes and child, white,
female, age 26; E T. Fenin, white, male, age 37;
D. W. Hockett, white, male, age 28; destinatio of all of the above was Cincinnati, O.; A. E Wigglesworth, white, male, age 24, destination
Louisville, Ky.; John Eccles, white, male, age 28,
destination Knoxville, Tenn. Two of these partie were put off the train at this place by the conduct-
or, as they had no railroad tickets, but they hel health certificates, and money being made up fo them, they went on to-day."
Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On Dalton train,
3:50 a. m., was W. B McMurray, white, age 28,
height 5 feet 9 inches, weight 170. He is a nativ of Jacksonville, Fla., but has a certificate showin residence in Gadsden, Ala., the past fifteen days,
and has not been in Florida since August loth He had a certificate from the United States office at Waycross showing that his baggage had bee fumigated. His destination was Knoxville, Tenn On the 12:05 train, F. M. Newhall, white, age 40,
from Palatka, Fla., and T. H. Lyons, white, age
36, from same place, which they left on September
22nd, traveling together to New York City. Ha certificates from the Board of Health, and one fo luggage from the United States officer. Yours o the 22nd to hand. I have now the assistance o the municipal officers in the quarantine work. I
have met no Decatur, Ala., or Jackson. Miss., ref-
ugees. If you have blanks for administering oath please send me some more."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch : "I have no ref-
ugees to report to-night. The following train have been discontinued by direction of the loca authorities: The Nashville, Chattanooga it St Louis that arrives at 9:50 p. m. and departs at 5
a. m.; t'ie Cincinnati Southern that arrives at 6:40
a. m. and departs at 7:55 a. m. On the Alabama
Great Southern all trains have been discontinued Memphis Ai Charleston trains only run betwee here and Stevenson, Ala. The East Tennessee,
Virginia & Georgia, Western & Atlantic and Chat-
tanooga, Rome A Columbus Railroads run al trains as usual. Trains on all roads p issing Wau-
hntchie are to be stopped and held there until pas-
sengers and baggage are inspected. Passenger will be compelled to procure health certificate from the agent at the depot from which they start:
this applies to all railroads entering the city. The
Western it Atlantic, East Tennessee, Virginia &
Georgia and Cincinnati Southern Railroads wil be treated in a like manner. Should a passenge from an infected point be found on any train, th whole train, passengers and all, will not be allowe to enter the city."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy : " I failed to fin any refugees from Decatur, Ala., Jackson, Miss.,
or Jacksonville, Fla., to-day. From Pensacola,
Fla., I found John Crosgrove, white, age 41; ha certificate from Mayor Chipley; issued him ours"
His destination was Cincinnati, O. I failed to re-
port the names, on the 22nd, of A. N. Nichols an wife, white, ages 33 and 31, from Bradford county,
Fla., destination Chicago, III. They had correc certificates; issued ours to them. I inspect th trains now in regard to points south of Decatu for the reason that a great many refugees have fle into Cullman, HarUelle and other points below
Decatur, and they might attempt to come into
Tennessee before ten days have elapsed since thei departure from Decatur, and in this way migh bring yellow fever into our State. I question th conductor upon all these points, and if I find  passenger from there I make him establish his cit-
izenship there, or that he has not been in Decatu in ten days past. This is applied to those wh have tickets to stop in the State Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "But fe passengers going west or south. The excitemen is unabated even in Memphis, as well as in the sur-
rounding towns. Many believe the fever exists in
Memphis. The railroads need not expect a modi-
fication of the present quarantine so long as th trains pass through the infected districts. Report from Jackson and Decatur not so alarming lo-dav,
but none can tell what a day may bring forth This point is well guarded."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "The North-boun trains on the Illinois Central Railroad, wit very few refugees from Jackson, Mississippi,
pass through Tennessee every day, but are no allowed by local authorities to stop at stations,
to put oft'or to take on any person whatever. Th whole country is panic-stricken and has quaran-
tined against everybo.ly and everything from the
South. I am daily threatened with quarantineb the towns along the line of the Illinois Central
Railroad for inspecting trains. Not being allowe to get off or on at Milan and other places, m daily movements are, to a considerable extent,
hampered. Only one mail out from here since last
Thursday. No north-bound trains on the Mobile
& Onto Railroad are allowed to stop at Corinth,
Miss., to put oft' or to take on passengers or freight No trains on the Louisville & Nashville Railroa go nearer than ten miles of Memphis Travel o the road, in consequence, is very light. I am do-
ing the best I can under the circumstances, an will continue as long as the Board desire."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "No suspicious per-
son or baggage have been reported to me to da by train inspectors. The party from Jackson,
Miss., alluded to in yesterday's report, went to St Louis, after a thorough disinfection of clothin and baggage. Several arrests have been made to-
day (by the city inspectors) of parties arrivin here since noon Saturday. None have proven t be from infected points. Since noon of the 22nd,
no one has been allowed by the local authuitie to come into this city from the east side of th river. At noon on the 25th the same rule wil apply to the west side." a
September 25th Newport—Inspector Peck: "For to-day I hav to report the following: II. C. Barr, white, male,

Cleveland—Inspector Brown: "On the 12:05 p.
m. train I found Wm P McMahon, white, age 47,
and his nephew J. G. Miller, age 23. They left
St. Augustine, Fla., on September 12th, and hav been staying in Atlanta, Ga. They have certifi-
cates from the Atlanta" authorities; destination
Pottsville, Pa. On the same train I found D. L Whitniore, white, age 37, from Tallahassee, Fla.,
which place he left on September 23d, bound for
Philadelphia, Pa.; had certificate from Leon
County Board of Health, and also U. S. M. H.S.
certificate for luggage. On the 3:50 a. m. trai there was no passengers from the infected points,
mostly from Atlanta and other points in Georgia Flagman Riggs, who runs into Selma, Ala., ever third day, informs me that the people of that plac suspect that yellow fever exists in the town of
Cullman, Ala., fifteen miles from Selma. I giv his report, not knowing whether it be true o otherwise. I shall keep the entire State of Ala-
bama in view, as liable to be an infected sectio oi country."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "Attached t the sleeper to-day was a car with five persons i it, claiming to come from Pensacola, viz.: B. O Heath, white, age 27; Minnie Heath, white, age
21 ; J. T. Heath, white, age 38, and two smal children of B. O. Heath, ages 2 and 3 years. The claimed to have come from Pensacola, Fla., bu swore that they came from Argyle, Fla, and the wanted to go to Memphis Tenn. As they wer evidently refugees, and there was some doubt a to where they came from, I administered to the our oath not to stop in the State, and took a de-
scription of them, which I enclose. Telegram i regard to passengers from Cullman and Flint re-
ceived ; will ohey instructions, in fact have alread inspected trains with reference to these points Inspector Whitson will run down to Athens ever night and come back on the 2:30 train, that h may have plenty of time to inspect the train an not have to detain it. With his assistance, n refugee can escape us"
Grand Junction —Inspector Prewitt: "Passe refugees west to-day, by dirt road going to Arkan-
sas; they were all l ight. We are to meet Capt Mann, Superintendent of the Illinois Central Rail-
road, this evening, to confer with him. Excite-
ment abating a little; no trains allowed to stop,
however."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "All trains on the
Mobile & Ohio Railroad discontinued. All loca trains on the Illinois Central have stopped; onl through trains now run."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors have not reported to me to-day any person o baggage from infected districts. The number o health certificates applied for by parties leavin the city has greatly decreased. There seems to b a marked improvement in the state of public feel-
ing as to our danger."
September 26th Newport—Inspector Peck: "The following i the report of yesterday: H. Sheldon, white, male,
age 22, walked from Hendersonville, N. C, t thi» place—he is a Florida refugee from Jackson-
ville—had no health certificate, so I arrested hi and sent him back into North Carolina; Andy

Gainesville, Fla., which place they left for At-
lanta over three weeks ago. Certificate from
Alachua County Health Officer, also certificat from Atlanta showing that they sojourned in tha city for twenty days. Present destination, New

This he was per-
mitted todo; name, E.J. Sadler, white, age 27,ligh hair, blue eyes, fair complexion, medium height;

Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "1 found from
Pensacola, Fla., to-day J. W. Babcock, white, age
57; destination Bay City, Mass. He had a cer-
tificate. I put off at State Line El Crocket and
Minnie Crockett, ages 32 and 21, while, wh claimed to have gotten on at King's Station. A they could show no evidence of their residence,
and wanted to stop in Nashville, I thought bes to put them off. I learned from a passenger after-
wards that they got on between Flint and Decatur From Flint, Ala., Geo. B. Gatlen, destination Al-
bany, N. Y.; H. L. Hunt, destination Boston,
Mass.; Jim Sanders, destination Bowling Green,
Ky.;OoraE Hunt, destination Boston, Mass Al took the oath, and I passed them on. When I
put Crockett and wife off at State Line, the car had stopped on the Alabama side of the line The guards came out in full force, and made th refugees get back on the cars, threatening deat to the conductor and engineer if they left the ref-
ugees there, I let refugees get on, and stop within
Tennessee line and put them off there. Here is  conflict between States How shall it be rem-
edied? These guards will not allow refugees t stop here, and in order to put them off, cars wil have to stop in Tennessee."
Pulaski—Inspector Whitson: "I met No. 4

zens, quarantine was again resumed by the loca authorities on all trains on both roads, Memphis
& Charleston and Illinois Central Railroads, there-
by showing the necessity of the general govern-
ment taking charge of the matter in conjunc-
tion with State Boards of Health."
Milan—Inspector Jordan: "No refugees from
Jackson, Miss, have passed on any of the train since last report. Refugees from other towns in
Mississippi pass every day, going through our
State. Under present local quarantine and non-
intercourse regulations, it is a difficult matter fo any person to gel off of trains at all. Great ex-
citement at Memphis. A suspicious case re-
ported."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "Nothing suspi-
cious reported to me to-day by train inspectors The suspicious case (Binford) would never hav created alarm but for the panicky condition of th public mind here; nor would it have been classe suspicious by the Board of Health, had the ma not been thought to have been at Decatur since it infection."

fected point in said State. J. C. Richards (wit above party) from Mobile, Ala.; no certificate Mr. Lawler certified that the gentleman was di-
rect from Mobile, en route to New York. Several
Florida refugees are writing to this city for boar rates, but as their non-exposure appears to be  matter of uncertainty, they were not given muc encouragement."
Chattanooga—Inspector Lynch: "I enclose yo the blanks filled nut by a party of refugets from
Camp Perry, who were detained at Citico to-day They came in on the East Tennessee, Virginia &
Georgia Railroad, and, after remaining at Citic until 6:20 p. m , departed for their several desti-
nations via the Cincinnati Southern Railroad."
Pulaski—Inspector Abernathy: "On to-day' trains I found Mrs. W. R. Brown, white, age 36;
daughter, age 14, from Hanceville, Ala.; also,
from same place, Mrs. T. H. Harbert and tw children, ages 30, 12 and 10, and also T. H. Har-
bert, age 34, and W. M. Brown. These people ha refugeed from Decatur, from yellow fever, to Cull-
man. When the first case appeared there they fled to
Hanceville, and to-day were on their way to Nash-
ville. They were out from Decatur several days,
but I thought it best to have them go through the
State, so I administered the oath, which I enclose Tom Card well, at Prospect, whose case was reporte to you by telegraph upon the 26th inst., is bette to-day. Has had no fever all day, and his phys-
icians pronounce his case now malarial fever."

4 at Athens, Ala., this morning; found no refu-
gees from Florida or infected points in Mississipp or Alabama. The case of Mr. Tom Cardwell, at
Prospect, Tenn., being a suspicious case. I tel-
egraphed Mr. Bradley, train dispatcher at Nash-
ville, to give No. 4 orders not to stop at Prospect
As no such orders were given No. 4, it stopped b signal I found it had stopped for passengers, but
I did not allow any one to board the train. I
had heard previous to leaving Pulaski that  young lady, a cousin of Mr. Tom Cardwell. wa stopping at his home, and intended to take No. 4
for Nashville, and as there were several ladies a the depot, I judge she was one of the party."

Jackson, Miss., or other fever infected points hav passed since last report. The panic is subsiding,
and reason and common souse are coming to th front at last."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The only admis-
sions into the city reported by the train inspector to-day have been parties allowed to enter by orde of the local Board of Health. No person or baggag being from infected localities, I take pleasure i reporting that the non-intercourse quarantine her has been raised, the former system of inspectio service being revived with special reference to in-
fected localities, thus relegating the health servic to the State Board of Health, where it properl belongs."

rying it in my clothing while inspecting refugee on trains, hence I take the precaution of fumigat-
ing my garments after each inspection trip."

Elora—Inspector Cruuk: "I have nothing t report of any interest. I have put off several ref-
ugees from Decatur and sent them back into Ala-
bama. I had the man Cochran, heretofore re-
ported by me, put over in Jackson county,
Alabama. I went down to Huntsville, Ala, to-da to investigate that case of yellow fever. I met
Drs. Dement, Lowery, Baldridge and Erskine They assured me ihey did not have any fears o its spreading there. I put off a brakeman here  day or so ago who had been running on the Mem-
phis <ft Charleston road, and sent him to Steven-
son, Ala. There are several refugees in this sec-
tion, hiding out from us. We have tried to cap-
ture them, but up to this writing have failed to d so. What do you think of quarantining against
Hnntsville? Dr. Lowery, Health Officer at tha place, informed me to-day that he would not issu any health certificates now since the developmen of tbe case of yellow fever there."

fected points. Travel very light. There is n longer need of an assistant, consequently wire you to-day from Athens. The excitement is sub-
siding all along the line. Athens hag taken of her guards, except at trains; Pulaski has don likewise. The cool weather has brought a feelin of security."
Pulaski—Inspector Whitson: " I found only tw suspicious persons on the train last night, namely:
J P. Feeney, white, age 24, destination Mt. Ver-
non, 111.; C. Worthinglon, white, age 29, destina-
tion Guthrie, Ky. I took their oaths and passe them through the State."
Grand Junction—Inspector Prewitt: "Excite-
ment abating; refugees returning home. Sobe reason, I trust, will soon be restored. Dr. Bigg and myself tried to stem the current, but to no pur-
pose. Much of this hasty action, I have no doubt,
appears ridiculous to the outside world, and I fo one regret to see it. The quarantine was workin well, and as evidence of it, no cases have devel-
oped of significance or consequence anywhere i this State. I think the restrictions Here will b removed October 1st."
Memphis—Inspector Ford: "The train inspect-
ors report nothing from infected localities to-day Travel is still light, nor will it probably increas much until Monday."

After the quarantine had been raised, as per or-

ugee from Decatur, Ala., came down from Louis-
ville, Ky., to his home in Murfreesboro sick. I proved to lie a case of yellow fever, the only cas which developed in Tennessee during the summer The following are the official reports of the loca health authorities concerning it:
Murfreesboro—Dr. R. S. Wendel, Health Offi-
cer of Rutherford county: ''I write to report  death here of yellow fever to-day. The subjec was a resident of this place, but had been in De-
catur, Ala., since Sept. 1st. He came home her aboutSept. 20th, and I gave him orders to remai closely at home for two weeks at least. Instead o that he went to Louisville, Ky., the next day, an returned here on the 2',lth sick. Dr. Murfree sa him next day and was suspicious of the case, an required the whole family to remain at home. I
visited the patient on Monday with Dr. M. an was fearful it was yellow fever, but very loth t believe it. The dwelling and bedding is being dis-
infected, and the family will remain isolated fo some days. The weather now being so cool, w hope to have no more cases. If anything more i necessary please inform me. The remains will b buried this evening. No excitement in town'
though some uneasiness."
Murfreesboro—Dr. J. B. Murfree, President City
Board of Health: "I have to report a case of yel-
low fever occurring in a refugee from Decatur,
Ala. Mr. Will. McKinley, whose parents live i this city, about 17 years old, was engaged in busi-
ness at Decatur, Ala., when the yellow fever epi-
demic began there. He left Decatur on the 19t of Sept. with quite a number of others who wer fleeing from the pestilence. He came to Murfrees-
boro but only remained a few hours and then wen on to Louisville, where he remained till last Sat-
urday, the 29th ult., when he left that place for
Murfreesboro. He arrived here last Saturda night at 9:30 p. m., and went directly to bed. H was seen by me on Sunday evening at 6 o'clock,
when he presented the premonitory symptoms o yellow fever. Our local Board of Health wa promptly notified of his presence in our midst an of his illness. The Board of Health took decide steps to isolate the case and his family. '< he en-
tire family were required to remain in the house,
and no one allowed to enter it from the outside Yesterday morning he presented unmistakabl symptoms of yellow fever. His condition continu-
ally grew worse, and he died to day at 1 o'cloc p. m. He will be quietly buried this afternoon,
the house thoroughly fumigated, and the famil will be kept isolated for the next two weeks."
Subsequently, upon October 10th, the followin additional particulars were received, detailing th steps taken after the death occurred Murfreesboro—Dr. J. B. Murfree, President

On the inside the carpet was taken up an the floor thoroughly scoured, and every day sinc the death of the patient carbolic acid has bee sprinkled over the floor and walls, and open ves-
sels containing chloride of lime have been place in different parts of the room, and sulphur ha been burnt with the doors and windows closed Lime in profusion has been thrown all around th house.

bolic acid and his burial clothes sprinkled wit it. No disinfectant was placed in the coffin. Th disinfection was done by my direction, and ex-
ecuted by Dr. J. S. Smilii, colored, and Mr. John
Davis, both of whom had had yellow fever. None o the family went to the cemetery with the remains,
and only a few friends, barely sufficient to bur him. The hearse was preceded by a detachmen of police, who warned every one off the street and caused all the doors and windows of th houses passed to be closed.

ant shade trees adjoining, and an unfailin spring of pure, cool water about halfwa down the hill. His fancy is caught, an he moves out with his family to the im-
mense improvement of health, tempe and happiness in general Being well pleased, he buys the place,
and invites an intimate friend to sta with him the next season. Friend so wel pleased that he proposes to board hi family with him, and, as there is not roo for all, brings a tent for them to lodg in. Eesult still excellent. Friend pro-
poses to buy or lease a small lot an build a cottage upon it, and the first set-
tler begins to see that by selling or leas-
ing lots he can get his summer residenc for nothing, and a little community, hal encampment, half village, grows u around the original settlement Additional land is now taken up an additional sales and leases increase th value and attraction by the resulting in-
crease of population, and by this time  definite character is impressed ou the set-
tlement. In one case, if the prevailin character is serious and moral, a lecture-

booths aud we have a summer resort,
full blast But by degrees it is found that th spring does not hold out sufficiently to ac-
commodate the increasing numbers, an its water is not as healthy as it was The soil, in fact, around it has becom saturated with the filth, offal, garbag which will accumulate where a numerou population is closely assembled, and peo-
ple begin sending to more distant spring at much inconvenience and without get-
ting the best sort of water Presently an epidemic of typhoid o scarlet fever, diphtheria, or malaria i some form breaks out, and a stamped results. The health resort become empty for that season This is a crisis in its career. One o two results has now to arrive: First, th place may be abandoned with considera-
ble loss to the original proprietor and th smaller purchasers and leaseholder of cottages; but, secondly, these peopl conclude that they cannot afford such  loss, and a meeting is held and (perhapS but not very likely) a professed sani-
tarian is consulted. For one thing,  new water supply is effected by wate conveyed from a distant spring, wel tested as to its quality, and an arrange-
ment is made for carting away filth an garbage every morning, and these ar-
rangements being extensively advertised,
population begins to return But with some improvements, th health is not such as it was in the inno-
cent infancy of the settlement. Th diurnal scavenger is inadequate; noxiou refuse accumulates in the cottages (whic are small and close together) waiting fo the scavenger; and, after another epi-
demic, it is found that some system o sewerage more efficient than the ox car with open barrels of abominations is de-
manded. Moreover, it becomes eviden that the whole settlement is badl planned, or, rather, has never bee planned at all; that the cottages are to close together; that they obstruct on another in regard to ventilation an drainage; in other words, the proprietor have a city on their hands with only th sanitary arrangements of a small encamp-
ment.
ANOTHER CRISIS And this time it requires enlightene enterprise and some courage to face it Ill-placed and crowded cottages must b removed, and in this way streets must b widened and straightened, and, above all,
a sewerage system commensurate wit the water supply already established But this, as has been said, requires a amount of enterprise and courage no always to be expected among the origina proprietors If somebody does not do it, the life o the health resort is again threatened, an a result under these circumstances ha more than once happened as follows:
The rent and purchase of cottages ha declined; the annual assemblage of com-
pany has fallen off, and the income ha become smaller and smaller, till it is n longer a paying investment; the whol thing is sold out for an old song; som long-headed capitalist becomes the pur-
chaser, remodels the whole on thoroug sanitary principles, and a first-class sum-
mer resort of permanent value results Typhoid Fever The number of localities reporting the ex-
istence of typhoid fever each month in Ten-
nessee demands of the local health authoritie immediate and careful investigation. No wate or soil contamination, no typhoid fever, is th axiomotic teaching of sanitary science, an consequently no weary weeks of suffering an prostration, no long nights of anxious watch-
ing by friends, and no untimely deaths, where-
as hundreds are now annually consigned t premature graves by this preventable scourge.

"No report. t Estimated Innoculation for Cholera At the meeting of the Academy of Sciences of
Aug. 20, M. Pasteur road a communication for
Dr. Gamaleia, of Odessa, in which the author give an account of the procedure he had adopted, whic is similar to that practiced by M. Pasteur for hy-
drophobia. Dr. Gamaleia had studied M. Pasteur' method in Paris, and his experiments with th choleraic virus upon animals have, according t him, proved successful. Dr. Gamaleia's metho is based on his discovery that pigeons inuoculate with the blood of guinea pigs which have been in-
noculated with cholera virus die from "dry chol-
era," with detachment of the intestinal epithelium That which is still more important is that the mi-
crobe appears also iu the blood of the pigeon which had succumbed. When the virus has thu passed through the pigeon it acquires such inten-
sity that one or two drops will kill pigeons in fro eight to twelve hours, and even destroy guine pigs. But when a pigeon was innoculated wit the uncultured virus it became refractory to th cultivated virus of the highest intensity of viru-
lence. If the culture-broth be heated to 120° C.
for twenty minutes, to destroy with certainty al the microbes which it contains, it is observed tha the heating had left in the sterilized culture a ver active toxic substance, which determines the char-
acteristic phenomena iu the animals experimente on. Dr. Gamaleia has expressed his readiness t repeat the experiments at Paris, in the presence o'
a committee of the Academy of Sciences, and t try on himself a sufficient dose for human inocu-
lation. M. Pasteur readily accepted the offer,
and it has been arranged that the experiment should be carried on in his laboratory in Novem-
ber.—Paris correspondent Medical Record All Should be Vaccinated
Vaccination's power of protection against small-
pox is effectually shown by the recently publishe statistics of the German Empire, iu which the prac-
tice of vaccination and revaccination is compulsory For the year 1886 the small-pox death rate for th whole empire was only .03 to each 100,000 of th population. In the larger cities it ranged from .07
in Berlin to 3.6 in Hamburg. Compared with the
German cities, the rates in other European citie where the practice is not compulsory, the deat rates from small pox ranged from .06 in Loudon to-
4.9 in Liverpool; Paris 9.0; Brussels 11.4; St. Pe-
tersburg 15.3; Moscow 34.1; Vienna 26.2; Venice
51.6; Rome 134.3; Genoa 153.8; Festh 368.7; Mar-
seilles 545.3 to the 100.000 of population. Mor than two-thirds of the deaths from small-pox in
Germany were in cities like Hamburg, which hav a large foreign shipping trade, and in those dis-
tricts which lie immediately along the Russian and
Austrian borders.—Sanitarian.

House-Sweepings and Consumption Cornet has experimented with the dust ob-
tained from the walls and floors of various dwell-
ings in which tuberculous patients had been; in-
noculating guinea pigs with it, and carefull excluding all possibility of infection from outsid sources. In this way twenty-one rooms of seven
Berlin hospitals were examined, and bacilli foun to have been present in the dust from most o them. Positive results were also obtained wit the dnst from insane asylums and penitentiaries The dwellings of fifty-three tubercular patient were investigated in the same way, and the dus in the neighborhood of twenty patients found t be virulent. It was the case with absolute regu-
larity that the dust was always virulent when th patient had been in the habit of spitting on th floor or in a handkerchief, while it was never s when a spit cup had been employed.—Munchener
Medicinische IVochenschrift, 1888, No. 308 Tornadoes - How to Escape Them The following valuable suggestions ar extracted from a little manual entitled,
"Tornadoes: What They Are, and How to
Escape Them," just issued by John P Finley, Lieutenant Signal Corps, United
States Army:
PROTECTION TO HUMAN LIFE The successful accomplishment of this objec depends upon the position and surroundings o the observer on the approach of the tornado, th character of motion possessed by the tornad cloud at the time, the width of the path of th storm, and the velocity with which it is moving The following precautions, which have been de-
termined upon as the result of careful investiga-
tion, observation and experience, are arranged i short paragraphs for easy reference and read memorizing If these rules and suggestions are strictly com-
plied with, they can be depended upon as furnish-
ing practical means for securing ample protectio to life and limb.
1. The south side is the dangerous portion of  tornado; the north side is the safe portion,
2. In the open country never undertake to es-
cape from a tornado cloud, without first makin sure of the points of trie compass, and that th direction which you propose to take is a lino a right angles to the path of the advancing cloud.
3. If the cloud is moving to the northeast, the the line of escape is to the northwest; if to th east, then to the north. Stand facing the advan-
cing cloud in the direct line of its approach, an the safe side ix always to tlie right.
4. To make escape certain, the tornado clou should be about throe-fourths of a mile distant This gives the observer a momentary chance t ascertain the character of motion it possesses, th velocity of progression, the w idth of the path, an the points of the compass These estimates must of necessity be approxi-
mate, but can be made sufficiently accurate to b depended upon. At a greater distance than three-
fourths of a mile it would be difficult, in mos cases, for the observer to obtain this informatio with any degree of satisfaction, unless the atmos-
phere was clear and the cloud advancing over th open prairie. It is presumed in this case, of course,
that the observer has been watching the approac of the tornado for some time. There is alway sufficient warning of the approach of these storms,
and plenty of time to prepare for them if the warn-
ings are heeded But there are always people who will persist i postponing action until it is too late to receive an benefit from it.
5. Make every effort to retain command of al of your senses on the upproach of a tornado, be-
cause your safety largely depends upon acting ju-
diciously, as well as correctly and quickly.
G. When trying to escape from a tornado neve run to the northeast, e<t.it or southeast.
7. If the tornado cloud is possessed of the oscil-
latory motion, swaying from side to side of th central line of cloud movement, the greatest car must be exercised in trying to make one's escape However much the cloud may depart from its gen-
eral direction of progression, it will eventuall come back to that direction further on its course,
so that when the entire truck is projected upon  chart it will be seen that the general direction ha been preserved, no matter what the departure ma have been at any time. If the cloud is zigzagging,
wait until it has recrosseil the track to the south,
and then move quickly to the north or northwest.
8. Never take refuge in a forest, a clump of trees,
or near any object that may be overturned by th wind. Your chance of escape from any injury i very much greater in the open field, where you ca watch the cloud and tuke the proper action at th right time.
9. Suppose the tornado cloud to be distant fro the observer one hundred and sixty rods and it progressive velocity (the average) forty-four mile per hour, it would then follow that one mile i passed in eighty-two seconds, and one hundre and sixty rods in forty-one seconds. Assumin the average width of the tornado's track to b eighty rods and the position of the observer at th center of that path watching the advancing cloud,
it will be seen that he has about forty-oue second in which to run a distance of about as many rods It is apparent from this calculation, which is base upon average results and rather underestimated,
that the observer must act quickly and intelli-
gently.
10. A frame building is safer than one built o brick or stone. The former is more elastic an holds together longer. The latter goes down i the first crash, anil the debris is whirled into  heap in the center of the foundation. This is es-
pecially the case where a brick or stone buildin stands alone. In a block of such buildings on structure supports another, and there is not quit so much danger of entire destruction In any event, however, the brick or stone build-
ing is the most dangerous, because it so readil crumbles and separates into falling masses tha the inmates are never safe from injury.
11. In a frame structure the safest place is i the cellar; but in a brick or stone structure it i the most dangerous. In the former case if th building is destroyed it is invariably carried awa from the foundation. In the latter case the cella is filled with debris.
12. The safest building to construct is one made

entirely of wood, with a " barn frame," and not t exceed one story and a half in height. Wher several buildings are connected together in a row,
the height may be increased one or more storie with safety.
13. No structure that rises above the surface o the earth, however made, can resist the violenc of a tornado, and therefore no building is safe a property, or as a resort to protect life.
14. Under no circumstances, whether in a build-
ing or a cellar, ever take a position in a northeas room, in a northeast corner, in an cast room, o against an east wall. Remember that the stor always approaches from the west and passes to th east, thus carrying all debris away from the wes wall.
15. If the observer's position, regarding the tor-
nado cloud, is such that he cannot escape from it fury by running in the proper direction, then h should throw himself prone (face downward) upo the ground, head to the east and arms placed ove the head to protect it. Never remain standin and attempt to weather the storm; it would prob-
ably cost you your life If one chances to be near a large stone or stump,
or some heavy object low down and firmly imbed-
ded in the ground, take a position directly to th cast of it, lying prone upon the earth, head towar the object, protecting the former with folded arms This advice is to be followed only in case of a emergency, when other and better opportunitie have been forfeited.
16. It is better, if possible, never to take refug near any object located within the center of th storm's path, especially not a tree or any objec that rises some distance above the surface of th ground.
17. If compelled to remain in a building not pro-
vided with a cellar, take a position on the first
(ground) floor Go to the west room, stand nea the center of it, and await the storm. It it appear that the building will be entirely destroyed, then i ia possible that the debris will be carried over an beyond you. It it is evident that only a portio of the house will be destroyed, then seek safety i the east room, standing near the center of it. for i is this portion of the house that will remain in cas of partial destruction Under any circumstances it is extremely perilou to remain in a house if it stands in the path of th tornado. Life and limb are in constant danger,
and there is nothing like safety to be secured The Climate of Nashville By L. X. Jbsunokskv, Serg't Signal Corps Located in latitude 30 deg. and 10 min. nort and SO deg. and 47 min. west, with an elevatio of 549 feet above mean tide, Mobile Bay, Nash-
villians enjoy a climate distinctly their own, dif-
fering in many respects from that of our siste cities—Knoxville, Chattanooga and Memphis. O the four, Kuoxville's mean annual temperature is
2 deg. lower; Chattanooga's 2 deg. higher, and tha of Memphis 3 deg. higher than that of Nashville The conditions of atmosphere, pressure and hu-
midity differ also. The barometer always stand higher in the eastern than in the western and cen-
tral portions of the State, the air being "banke up," as it might be called, in the mountainous re-
gions of Knoxville and Chattanooga. The percent-
age of relative humidity of the air is the greates at Memphis. Onr highest atmospheric pressur occurs in November, and the lowest in June or
July. The mean annual temperature at Nashvill is 59.6°, and for the seasons—spring 59.3°, sum-
mer 78.4°, autumn 59.7°, winter 41c January i our coldest month and July our warmest. It oc-
casionally happens that the hot waves extend fa into August, producing higher temperatures tha in July. This was the case in August, 1874, in
1881, and dnring the first two weeks of August,
1888. The extremes in temperature at Nash-
ville during the past twenty years were from 104'
in August, 1874, to 10° below zero in January,
1884, making the extreme range 114c. The ver low temperature of 7C below zero during the firs week in February, 1880. was the most severe ex-
perienced in thirty-two years The occurrence of the first and last frosts hav also a great bearing on the climate and produc-
tions of this locality, in that it is one of the great-
est interest and value in that respect to the florist,
farmer and producer of fruits and vegetables. Th following table shows the dates of first and las frosts for each year at Nashville, Tenn., from 1871

The northwest winds prevail at Nashville, th westerly come next in frequency, followed in thei order by those from the south, southwest, south-
east, east, north and northeast. Contrary to pop-
ular belief, the month of March does not show th greatest hourly and total wind velocities. Jan-
uary is accredited with the highest hourly an total wind movement, with only slight difference between the velocities of February and March The winter months show a greater total win movement, but the hourly maximum wind veloci-
ties, or extremes, usually occur during June and
July. The high wind velocities in the winte months are of a more steady and uniform charac-
ter. To illustrate: During the passage of a col wave, accompanied by an area of high atmospheri pressure, across our State from the northwest to-
ward the southeast, the winds in front rarely ex-
ceed a maximum velocity of 48 miles per hour,
and often blow at an actual rate of 30 to 35 mile from lour to six hours continuously. The violen gusts of wind before a thunder-storm in summer.

No other class o especially in June and July, are more to be dreade than the high winds of winter. It may also hap-
pen that these gusts are not always confined t one particular spot alone, immediately in front o a thunder-storm, but that several other gusts ma be moving in the same direction in common wit the thunder-storm, parallel to each other, and a short distances apart. Tornadoes are most fre-
quent in the spring and summer months. Thei possible occurrence in winter, most notably in
January and February, can be easily accounted
All records accessible relating to tornadoe in this region during the winter months for th past twenty years prove that the seasons were un-
usually mild ; that the winds came from som southerly point, and thus admitting of a heav indraught of air from the excessive moist regio further southward with steep temperature gra-
dients, therefore producing the violent whirls com-
mouls termed tornadoes. This type of storms i not of a separate lass; they usually occur within
75 to 400 miles from the center of the large storms, and in their southeast quadrants. Unlike
Georgia, Alabama and Northern Mississippi, thi region is remarkably free from tornadoes. Durin the past thirty years two destructive storms o this class were experienced here, namely, June -,

of the investigator than the tornado. Enoug facts have already been developed to prove tha there is a uniform lair of tornadoes just so sure a the unknown law of precipitation prevails. Whe these two important links in the science of mete-
orology are connected, the solution of the remain-
ing problems will be an easy task One thing of the greatest importance, and on to which the least attention is paid, and the mos ditficult to obtain, is the relative amount of mois-
ture in the air, or, as it is usually called, percent-
age of relative humidity of the air. Since climati changes afl'ect very largely the health of a com-
munity, as well as soil-character and drainage, i becomes highly important to study the moistur of the atmosphere, both relative and absolute-
the precipitation, the wind directions and veloci-
ties direct, and to note the relations existing be-
tween the purity and quantity of the wir which i inhaled; the exhalations emitted from moist soils;
their capacity for retaining moisture, and th rapidity with which they dry; the depth of well-
water, etc.--all require the earnest and thought-
ful co-operation of the meteorologist with that o the pathologist. We are as much in need of pre-
ventive medicine as curative medicine. In thi respect, as well as in all that relates to tempera-
ture, Nashvillians enjoy a moderately dry atmos-
phere, as shown by the following figures: The an-
nual average of the percentage of relative humid-
ity of the air is 68.7 per cent., and for the seasons:
Spring 65.4 per cent , summer 67.1 per cent., au-
tumn 70.1 per cent., and winter 72.1 per cent In the subjoined table of averages appear th results of the observations made by the United
States Signal Service in this city for the years

STATE BO ABB OF HEALTH BULLETIN The average annual precipitation amounts to
51.88 inches, and for the seasons as follows:
Spring 14.09 inches, summer 13.47 inches, autumn
10.29 inches, and winter 14.03 inches. The averag amount for the growing season, from March to
October, inclusive, is 33.9") inches. The utility o knowing the rainfall is sufficiently obvious. It study is of great interest to the agriculturist; th development of his productions, as well as hi daily labors, are dependent upon the excess o deficiency of rain. As rain is an important sourc of water supply to our river, reservoir and th like, it is evident that a knowledge of the rainfal for any season or month, as furnished by average of the observations of former years, may be th means of enabling our hydraulic engineers to es-
timate the future water supply. Heavy rainfal bears a close relation to soil drainage, and is on of the most important from a sanitary point o view. The vulgar term "a regular gully-washer"
is of more significance than one would suppose Aside from the few inconveniences of having  cellar partially flooded here and there by a heav rainfall, our streets are thoroughly cleansed—

September, inclusive, show the greatest number,
with a maximum number in June. A careful stud of the seventeen-year record of clear, fair ani cloudy days reveals a clear weather period durin the first two weeks in October. The so-called
"Indian summer," or hazy condition of the atmos-
phere, becomes more prevalent in September and
October, though its appearance is not uncommo in any month of the year Observations for ozone, begun upon request o the State Board of Health, have not been in forc for a sufficient length of time to obtain any defi-
nite results. Suffice it to say that the two ex-
tremes in the coloration of the iodide-potassium-
coru-starch tests—alsolute zero to 10 deg. on th scale—have already been reached during the pas two years of observation. True records of ozon cannot always be obtained in the city, more espe-
cially in the winter, since the carbonic and sul-
phurous gases arising from combustion of fuel hav a tendency to darken the test-papers more so tha from natural causes. The mean of ozone for th past two years' record is as follows: For the a. m.
observation, 0.9°; p. M. observation, 1.2° The mean annual height of the Cumberland
Kiver is 10.6 feet. The month with the highes mean is February, which stands at 21.3 feet, an the month with the lowest mean is October, 2.3
feet. The highest water during the past sixtee years, 54.6 feet, occurred in January, 1882; th lowest, 0.4 feet below zero of the gauge, aero o the gauge being low water of September, 1863—
occurred in October, 1876, the extreme range o the Cumberland being then 57 feet The high water of January, 1882, will long b remembered. During the period from Jan. 11 to
Feb. 22, 2,680 families were rendered homeless Should this community be threatened with anothe flood such as that, all danger can be averte through the timely assistance from the specia river stations of the Signal Service on the upper
Cumberland, established in December, 1885 Navigation on the Cumberland closes betwee the 5th and 20th of July, and is resumed betwee tho 10th and 25th of November. During the pas seventeen years navigation remained closed bu once during the autumn. This occurred in 1876 On July 16, 1876, navigation was suspended, re-
maining so until July 21, 1876, when it was re-
sumed, continuing until Aug. 19, 1876. Fro this time on throughout the remaining months o the year the water was exceedingly low. A sever cold wave set in during the last three days of tha year, chilling the light body of water rapidly, s that by the morning of Jail. 1, 1877, its surfac became congealed to the thickness of severa inches. This state of affairs existed until Jan. 7,
1877, at which time a rapid rise from the head-
waters caused the ice to move. The shortest pe-
riod during which navigation was suspended oc-

Consumption in Animals and Men The first session of the Congress for the Stud ol Tuberculosis iu Men and Animals was held in
Paris ou the 25th and 31st of July last, under th presidency of Prof. Chauveau The presence of bacillus in cases of tubercule i now almost universally accepted as the most rea-
sonable theory, and the efforts of practitioners ar directed to the destruction of this element. I the treatment so far has not met with much suc-
cess those interested may find more if they direc their attention to its prevention The conclusion of the Congress is that the sourc of infection is in the use of food infected with tu-
bercle and that to prevent the spread of tubercl it is sufficient to thoroughly cook the meat an always to boil the milk. The following were th principal subjects of deliberation:
1. More extensive powers should be given t boards of health, and the general surveillance o committees on epizootics should be given to them,
and consequently the diseases of animals and al questions relating to the contagions of domesti animals, even those which heretofore have no been considered transmissible to man, should b submitted to them
2. The Congress has seen with satisfaction tha tubercular diseases among cows has been place among contagious diseases, and the decree ha been signed by the President of the Republic.
3. It will be necessary to insist firmly on th necessity of seizing and destroying all the meat o animals affected with tuberculosis, wherever ma he the place from which they come, or whateve may be their apparent health.
4. These considerations are applicable to ever country in the world, because wherever the plac may be the question of tuborculosis presents th same problems for solution as in France.
5. It is necessary to distribute among the peo-
ple, especially in the country, such plain and in-
telligible instructions as wilfenable them to guar against the dangers of eating the meat or drinkin the milk of tuberculous animals. They shoul also be instructed as to the best means of disin-
fecting animals aud animal excreta, and of enablin them to destroy all the germs of disease.
6. Cows intended for the production of mil should be subject to a special supervision to pre-
vent the milk of any tainted with contagious dis-
ease from being offered for use. and this supervis-
ion should extend alike to all establishments i which animals are kept for such production.—San-
itarian Sanitary Science and Military Life.
A quarter of a century ago the death rate in th guards was 20 per 1,000; it is now 6£ per 1,000,
due to applied sanitary science, and, as I coul show, it is yet much too high. The death rate i the home army was 17 per 1,000; it is now about
8 per 1.000. But Germany beats us with he death rate of 5 to 6 per 1,000. In France it is 10
per 1,000, in Austria 11, in Italy 11, in Russia 18,
an army death rate three times heavier than iu
Germany. The old Indian array death rate was
69 per 1,000; from 1879 to 1884 the death rate wa reduced to 20 per 1,000, and now it is about 14 per
1,000. In the six years from 1879 to 1884 the ag-
gregate saving was 16,910 lives, aud, on the mili-
tary estimate of £100 per life, the saving in mone during these six years (as estimated by our lat eminent sanitary ally, Prof. De Chaumont, of Net-
ley, whose loss is greatly to be deplored) was
£ 1,691.000; and, at the present reduced rate of 14
per 1,000, the saving may again be reduced in pro-
portion.—Edwin Chadwick, C. B.
♦
Sanitary Science and Civil Life Nowhere in this country has the sanitarian been mor energetic than in the lower valley of the Mississippi Typhoid fever is never absent from New Orleans, and,
with no other change in conditions except the enforce-
ment of sanitary regulations, the death rate from tha disease has been reduced from 68 per 100,000 of populatio to 10 in less than twenty years; and the decrease has ex-
actly kept pace with the sanitary improvements. An here is a place for comparison. The sewage of New Or-
leans cannot pollute the water supply, rain water fro huge tanks being used. In Philadelphia, where the wate is known to be contaminated, the death rate from th same disease has increased from 56 to 66 per 100,000 in th same period. Pennsylvania has at last found it expedi-
ent to establish a health board. In Michigan the savin of life from scarlet fever in the last eleven years amounte to 3,718; and in 1880 appropriate sanitary measures save the lives of 298 persons, who, under the usual condition and according to former epidemics, would have died o diphtheria in a few localities. In Nashville the deat rate has been reduced in fourteen vears from 84.f>5 per
1,000 to 10.36 per 1.000. In Memphis the death rate ha been reduced in six years from 35 per 1,000 to 23.8 per
1,000. In Chicago the death rate has been reduced in th last rive years from 26 per 1,000 to 19.46, a saving of nearl twenty thousand lives. These important facts arc littl in comparison with the incalculable work that is bein done in most of the large centers of population through-
out the country, and are thrown out as simple indica-
tions that things are done to justify the confidence of th public in measures of public health. Defective statistic leave the best work unnoted. In Massachusetts, wher statistics are collected, sanitary regulation has reduce the death rate from infectious disease in ten vears from
28.6 per 100,000 to 18.5.—J. If. Kaine.

Well Water The well on the farm is a source lrom whic comes many diseases. Some wells are neve cleaned. When dug they are carefully boarde over, the pumps made tight and snug, with th ground sloping away on all sides, so as to allo the surface water to flow from the opening. Ther is no well water that is pure. Something depend on the character of the soil. If sandy, and th water will quickly disappear from the surfac after a rain, the well will drain the soil for a lon distance around it, and the consequence will b that a large portion of the soluble filth of the soi will find its way into the well, although the wate may appear sparkling and bright. It is contende that the soil removes all the impurities from th water, but this depends upon whether the soil, b long-continued absorption, be not already s thoroughly saturated with impurities as to refus to take up more. That the soil docs not remov all impurities, even from new ground where  well has been recently dug, has been demonstrate by staturating the surface earth at a distance fro the well with kerosene oil, which gradually foun its way to the well (having been washed down b the rains) and imparted its odor to the water. I the soil be of heavy clay the danger will b lessened, but on all porous soil the liability of pol-
lution of the water is great. No manure heaps,
privies, sinks or other receptacle for filth or refus of any kind should be within 150 feet of the well—
the further off the better. No matter how tigh the well may be the toad will sometimes continu to get in. Many wells contain toads that die an are swallowed in the drinking water unknowingly,
under the supposition that the well is tight and
"toad-proof." Wells should be thoroughly cleane at least once a year, and especially in the fall For a distance of ten feet around the well the sur-
face should be cemented, and the pump it-sel should be cleaned occasionally. Toads, flies,
bugs, worms, and even gnats, will get in th water, while only a few drops of a solution from  filthy drain or sink, finding its way into the well,
will carry bacteria enough to rapidly multi-
ply aud contaminate all of the water. Roots o trees and vines also serve as drains into the wells,
as they loosen the soil, and for that reason the should never be planted near the source of drink-
ing water.—Sanitary News.

SUBSCKIPTION,
25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postofflce at Nashville as Second Class Matter The State Penitentiary The Tennessee penitentiary was erecte in 1829—more than half a century ago. I was located, planned and constructed fo the wants, and according to the architect-
ural ideas of that time. For a quarter of  century after its construction its dead wer buried inside its own inclosure; and al garbage and excremental matter found se-
pulture in the same soil It was then situated one mile or mor from the population of Nashville—not en-
dangered by epidemics in the city, and, i turn, not endangering to any considerabl extent the city's population by any pesti-
lence that might arise within its walls. It own population was small, suffering none o the evils incident to our crowded prisons,
save only the evils of limited air space i the cells, the largest being less than one-
half the space allowed by sanitary require-
ments for one individual Now, unfortunately, all the internal con-
ditions and external environments of thi prison are changed—changed for the worse The worse for the inmates of the prison—
the worse for the population that is crowde around its walls. Inside the walls, instea of a population of from one to two hundred,
giving to each convict a cell, now, with les than one-half the State's convicts within th walls of this institution, we have five to si hundred people living in the day on thi spot of earth loaded with the excreta an dead bodies of a former generation, an packed, at night, with two or three con-
victs in each of these diminutive cells lik sardines in a box The wonder is, not that the death rate i so large, but that it is, under the circum-
stances, so small The eccentric growth of the city of Nash-
ville has swallowed up the prison. An instead of being, as when constructed,  mile without her borders, it is now in th midst of her population. And, by the con-
stant and unavoidable intercommunicatio carried on between the convicts withi and the population without through th medium of employes, a pestilence on eithe side of the walls will be transferred to th other If the prison stood on non-polluted soil,
and had been constructed and could b managed as a modern prison according t the established laws of sanitary science, then,
in the midst of the Capitol City of the State,
it would be but a blot to mar her beauty,  deformity to mortify her pride; but stand-

ing, as it does, upon a soil reeking wit poison and with death, and built, as it was,
in utter violation of every sanitary consid-
eration, it is a constant menace to the pop-
ulation around it; a festering, contaminatin sore, not only marring the beauty but en-
dangering both the health and the life o those inside and out Every consideration of humanity, of in-
terest, and of duty, not only to the miser-
able wretches immured within its walls, bu to the population around, demand that th prison site be changed and the prison re-
constructed Loose or Chained Small-pox is known to have existed fro ancient times, and to have made fearfu havoc among remote communities. Ther is no doubt that it prevailed in Hindostan,
and probably in China, before the tim of Hippocrates. In the sixth century i was carried to Europe by the Mohammed-
ans from Egypt and Arabia. It was car-
ried from the Netherlands to Germany i the same year that Columbus discovered
America. In less than half a century i was imported into America, and is estima-
ted to have destroyed six out of the twelv millions of Indians who occupied the terri-
tory of the present Union. In 1707 i destroyed one-quarter of the entire popula-
tion of Ireland These familiar historic data are full o significance to us, to-day, in Tennessee an other States similarly favored with a large
African population, most valuable for thei contributions to the material wealth of th land, and most vulnerable to because poorl protected against small-pox The first grand example of preventiv medicine, and which may be looked upo as the starting point of the great popula movement now called Statar Medicine,  system which applies by State and munici-
pal ordinances the splendid advances i physical, chemical and biological science,
to the well-being of the masses, was th result of the long, patient and thoroug researches of the immortal physician. Ed-
ward Jenner, a hundred years or more ago Macaulay gives a vivid picture of th desolation caused in England by the preva-
lence of small-pox before the discovery o vaccination. "That disease, over whic science has since achieved a succession o glorious and beneficent victories, was the the most terrible of all the ministers o death. The havoc of the plague had bee far more rapid; but the plague had visite our shores only once or twice within livin memory; small-pox was always present,
filling the church-yards with corpses, tor-
menting with constant fear all whom it ha not yet stricken, leaving on those whos lives it spared the hideous traces of it power, turning the babe into a changelin at which the mother shuddered, and makin the eyes and cheeks of the betrothed maide objects of horror to her lover. During th century previous to the discovery of vacci-
nation, small-pox is calculated to hav destroyed 45,000,000 of the people of
Europe."
Jenner investigated in a scientific an practical manner the popular belief that
"one who had had cow-pox could no take small-pox, and performed in 1775 th first vaccination with cow-pox virus. Afte the introduction of vaccination into Swede the annual death rate from small-pox fel from 1,973 to 479 Per million, and afte vaccination was made compulsory this aver-
age was further reduced to 180 per million In the German army during the Franco-
Prussian war all soldiers entering the arm had to be re-vaccinated, and there wer only 263 deaths from small-pox; in the
French army this was not required, an there were 23,368 fatal cases of this dis-
ease. The sum total of men in thes armies was not far from equal Estimating the population of Tennesse at 1,835,000, the probable annual mortality

from small-pox without the system of pre-
ventive measures resulting from Jenner' discovery would be 3,640. Imperfectly a this system is carried out within the Stat the annual mortality from small pox is, s far as can be ascertained from our wretch-
edly incomplete returns of vital statistics,
only a few units; in some years none.
A settled point it is that vaccination i the prophylactic against small-pox in th individual. Inspection, isolation, disinfec-
tion and vaccination protect the commu-
nity In Tennessee there can be no doubt tha a very large number of persons have neve been vaccinated, and that multitudes nee re-vaccination. Many intelligent practi-
tioners of medicine estimate the number o our people who are unprotected by vacci-
nation and hence exposed to small-pox, if,
by accident or otherwise, they come in con-
tact with, or near to, infected persons, a at least one-fourth. Others even place it a high as one-third. At all events, the negli-
gence on this point is as inexcusable as i is alarming. It is a disgrace to the medica profession of the State, who should loo better after their wards than this. It is  reproach upon our county and local board of health, which have been repeatedl warned within the past few years by sever epidemics in other portions of America an by outbreaks in our own State, which, i some instances, have laid heavy costs upon
•city or county, and in all cases have onl been prevented from spreading into exten-
sive epidemics by the energetic action o the State Board of Health This negligence of family physicians an this lethargy of county and local board should be no longer tolerated by an intelli-
gent community. Parents should see to i that all the members of their families ar guarded from a most loathsome disease,
which may be taken from neglected bed-
ding in a sleeper or from sitting near an in-
fected passenger in an ordinary railwa coach. Instances enough of this descrip-
tion are on record to make considerate peo-
ple careful Every city, town and village in Tennes-
see should institute a general and thoroug vaccination, systematically carried out an registered. All the poor should be vaccinate at the public expense, with the best bovin virus, and by competent physicians, wh shall keep the proper records, and give du certificate in each instance It is a pernicious error to look upon thi operation in minor surgery as one of trivia moment, which may be performed by an tyro or ignoramus. Certainly, when its ob-
ject and effect are considered, it is of first-
class importance, giving immunity from  frightful pest and security from constant un-
easiness when thrown out upon the grea stream of travel, as nearly everybody i nowadays Vaccination as a safeguard has bee much depreciated in public opinion, an also failed of due effect because of the mis-
erably stingy and ineffective manner i which it has too often been carried out b city and town boards in Tennessee. Th first serious mistake is that of complete in-
action when no epidemic occurs or i threatened, and then rushing through  large amount of work most hastily an carelessly performed in the midst of panicky-
alarm, and it may be at a very unfit season,
when the virus will not remain good an length of time. The time for thorough,
systematic, recorded and certified vaccinat-
ing, private and public, is always, an specially when epidemic fright is unknown The second error is not less fertile i fruitlessness, to-wit: The employment at  rate of compensation hardly fit for a da laborer of physicians who can find no othe patients, who are required to rush throug with the vaccination of a populous city o extensive suburbs in double-quick time, s as to make the final report of expenditure moderate and economic.

not to be tolerated. Experts should be em-
ployed, at fair professional pay, and vacci-
nation should be perpetually in vogue There is no excuse for negligence. Goo bovine virus may be obtained through an druggist from a number of reliable vaccin farms at reasonable prices, in large or smal quantities, as needed. It is now a settle point that for all urban population thi should be used and not the humanized. I rural districts, where everybody is wel known, it may be permissible to follow th old custom of obtaining the virus from  healthy person; not elsewhere Milk and Milch Cows.
BY DANIEL V. WRIOUT, M. D.
A good cow, well kept, is a health officer i ever}* family—the best that can be had next t the family doctor—unless the doctor comes afte the cow, which, as this journal is mainly read b doctors, it would hardly be safe for us to main-
tain. In large cities the possession of a famil cow is generally unattainable, but the cities in
Tennessee are not yet very large, and there are no many of them, so that, with good management,  very large majority of Tennessee families ca keep a cow. It is for such families that the pres-
ent paper is written It is proposed here to give some attention to th breeds of inilch cattle in reference to their claim for a position in well-regulated families as th nursing mothers of the coming generation. Tw opposite types will best exemplify our meaning—
two breeds of cows which have, of late, been cul-
tivated with much skill and care by stock breeder in this State with inestimable benefits to our gen-
eral stock of cattle. These are the Jersey an the Ilolstein breeds These two are selected as being both excellen in their kinds, but widely contrasted in regard t their respective merits The Jersey produces relatively a small volum of milk, with a wonderful abundance of cream i it, while the Ilolstein gives a very large volum of milk much less rich in cream, so that even th small yield of the Jersey milk produces mor cream thau the abundant yield of the Holstein To compensate for this the Ilolstein milk is muc richer in casein (the material of cheese) than the
Jersey milk; this contrast indicates the commer-
cial destination of the two products—the Jerse dairies send butter to market, the Ilolstein dairie cheese To compare their relative adaptation for huma food (especially children's food) it should b stated that human milk contains less of bot cream and casein (butter and cheese) than th average cow's milk and mom of another valuabl constituent, milk sugar; and, as a consequence,
it has been found necessary in preparing milk fo weaned infants to dilute cow's milk with water an add sugar—milk sugar in preference to cane-
sugar.
I had some opportunity last summer of studyin the Jersey breed through the kindness of a friend,
who has cultivated that variety with great zea and corresponding success. He invited me to hi house, threw open his dairy to me, allowed me t make any experiments I de.-ired, and aided nie i doing so. The Jersey cow seems to me to be th most highly specialized animal that has been cre-
ated by artificial selection. The end aimed at b breeders has been to evolve a butter-producin animal, and to this purpose, has been sacrificed al the qualities that give value to other breeds. Th animals are small, producing little flesh and les fat, and even their milk has been specialized,
cream being its leading constituent; one speci-
men tested by the cremometer gave a ratio of one-
third cream and two-thirds of all other constitu-
ents; in short, everything the animal eats turns t cream. My friend makes his profit by selling thi in the form of butter in winter time and in sum-
mer he supplies the confectioners with their ma-
terial for ice cream For family use, supposing only oue cow to b kept, this animal would not be a judicious «elec-
tion, for in this case the fresh inilk not manufac-
tured into either cream or butter is the one thin desired; but if two can be kept, let one of the be of the Jersey type, to supply the butter fo family use, aud so secure its owner from the con-
tamiuatious of oleomargarine, hoy's lard and othe abominations which have now become almost uni-
versal in the dairy market. The milk of Jerse cows is not healthy for children for two reasons,
its excess of cream and its defect of the other val-
uable constituents, such as casein, milk sugar an lactic acid. It is true it may be diluted so as t obviate its positive evils, but this docs not remed its negative qualities depending upon the defect specified So completely are these objections recognize by breeders as applicable, not only to human bu to bovine infants, that they will not allow their
Jersey calves to suck their own mothers: the have a saying among themselves that Jersey mil is poison to calves, and they furnish them either

with the milk of other cows or their mother's mil diluted This again shows how highly specialized a prod-
uct the Jersey cow is—not a product of nature,
but of human art—in a state of nature the hree could not exist but for one generation, the calve being all poisoned with their mother's milk For the family using but one cow, then, w would recommend a different type, that repre-
sented by the Holstein breed, the milk of whic is produced in larger quantities and contains les cream, but is richer in the other nutritive princi-
ples, especially casein, an element which the
Jersey breeder would rather do without, as he
.says it imparts to his butter a tendency to gro rancid. But of the two, the casein is the mor valuable nutritive principle, being a plastic ele-
ment, capable of conversion into human tissue,
while the cream is only a hydro carbon, sub-
servient mainly to the respiratory or heat-produc-
ing function. The Holstein milk, therefore, no only is produced in greater abundance, but con-
tains pint for pint more of human nutriment While, however, we recommend animals of the
Jersey type for one purpose, and the Holstei type for another, we must not be understood a recommending the pure-blooded stock of eithe for family use In the first place the full-blooded importe breeds are too expensive for that purpose; th specialists who import and breed from them rel mainly for their profits not on the produce of thei animals, but upon their progeny; nor, in the nex place, are they so healthy or hardy as our nativ stock, or as they were in their own country prio to importation. Partly by natural and partly b artificial selection every country has produce races of animals best adapted to thrive under th surroundings furnished by that country, such a climate, pasturage, water, etc. The Holstei cattle thrive well in the deep, moist, succulen pasture of the Holstein meadows; the Jersey find a shorter but richer grass on the gently undu-
lating hills and valleys of their native island,
which, through the tempering breezes of the Brit-
ish channel, has the inestimable advantage o lasting the year through, being neither dried u l>y the summer heat, nor killed by the rigors o winter. And so our native stock has, by gradua adaptation, acquired the hardiness to resist th trials of our burning summers and freezin winters But neither do I recommeud the unmodifie native stock for our ideal family cow. Experienc has proved that the indigenous stock of any coun-
try may be improved by judicious crossing wit foreign races: thus our native stock may acquire
.improvement in regard to its butter produce by  cross with the Jersey, or, as to its flow of milk,
by a similar blending with the Holstein, and, i both cases, the improvement is effected withou impairing the constitutional stability of the nativ breed; and, in this way, we do not doubt th ultimate establishment of American races pos-
sessing the valuable milking qualities of the im-
ported stock combined with the health and hardi-
ness of the home breed To be practical, however, our advice to mate familias, in selecting a family cow, is to purchas an animal whose mother is a grade cow, possess-
ing the constitutional vigor required, and whos sire is a handsome little Alderney, if it is crea or butter that she wants, or a lordly Holstein, i she desires a copious flow of milk, rich in nourish-
ment for her growing children And in either case our fee for this good advic is a seat at her table in the strawberry season.

"You have been kind enough to forward regu-

letin during the past year, for which accep thanks.
"On looking over the reports as received, I fin none from our county. Not being a physician, I
can't give statistics of county at large, but think
Marion county will compare favorably with an other section of the State, or, in fact, of the entire
South.
"Jasper, the county site of Marion, has between
800 and 1,000 inhabitants, and has had but eigh deaths in nearly five years.
"One was a small boy, who fell off a low build-
ing, injuring his spinal cord, from which ho lin-
gered two or threo months and died; another wa a child born with scrofula, and when it began t cut teeth it took bowel complaint and died; an-
other child died from cutting teeth and bowe complaint; one was burned to death; a woma died of puerperal disease, and the child followe soon after; one old man died of cancer, and an-
other old man of carbuncle and dissipation.
"This is our death list since 1884 in Jasper. I
do not know how long before that (as I only bega to take note in 1884) that there had been a deat in Jasper. It might have been a year or two, as
I have known it to be over a year between death here. I was born within two miles of Jasper, an my father moved to the town in 1836, where w have lived except a short time ever since."

A Lesson in Sanitation It is certainly a safe assertion that the city of
Wilmington has enjoyed several months of un-
usual health, and it is a just cause of congratula-
tion and thankfulness that this delightful condi-
tion has evidently been largely, if not entirely,
the result of the cleansing stimulated by th threatened invasion of yellow fever. As far a we can judge from the tables of the Signal
Service here, there has been no unusual atmos-
pheric surroundings to bring about the result tha we claim for the efficient work of the healt officers and their corps of laborers It is beyond dispute that the streets have bee cleaner than ever before in many years, and tha the belated doctor did not have his nose, assaulte with the odors of uncared-for privies, which hav so long made the damp air of night disagreeabl and noxious. Back lots have heen emptied o unwholesome accumulations, and alleys, where th sun was too often a short visitor, were purge of their filthy soil-coverings and put in good
•order. Streets were kept clear, or nearly so, o unsightly piles of trash, and less dependence wa placed upon the good offices of the thirsty soil t take up the deposits that have heretofore bee neglected, instead of being hauled away an burnt, as they have been this season The death-rate has been lowered remarkably,
aud the sickness less than any of our physician here could have expected. There is a valuabl lesson to town authorities everywhere in the Stat in this happy condition of things, and the hop is fostered that it will not be lost here. The publi will, we feel sure, learn that a confiding an helpful assistance to the efforts of the health au-
thorities is always to be met by the best efforts o these officials to preveut disaster, that is too dire,
very often, to be cured, if allowed to find a abiding place in a community. Let the winte months, now almost upon us, be marked by th same care for the whole town on the part of th authorities, and with the advent of the hot month there will come the feeling of safety that our ex-
perience of the past month justifies.—Xortlt Caro-
lina Medical Journal Hog cholera prevails in Hancock county, Ohio In Portage township alone more than six thousan hogs have died of the disease. — Ex.

STATE BO ABB OF HEALTH BULLETIN Is Consumption Contagious?
Au international congress of nearly five hun-
dred physicians, lately in session in Paris, wa practically unanimous that consumption, or tu-
berculosis, is contagious and transmissible be-
tween man and beast. There was unanimit also as to the prime necessity of boiling milk an cooking meat well as a preventive of much of th consumption which now inflicts the human race None of these conclusions are new, hut they de-
rive additional force from the unanimity wit which they were declared and accepted as fact well established. It was stated that if boilin milk and thoroughly cooking meat are practice as a rule, one of the leading causes of tuberculosi will disappear. Hy tuberculosis is to be under-
stood not consumption alone, but various othe forms of the same disease, and also meningitis,
white humors, and scrofula. It seems to hav been very generally admitted by the congress tha tuberculosis may be easily communicated throug the digestive organs by our food, or through th blood by inhalation. The expectoration of a con-
sumptive dairyman carelessly spit upon the ha which the cow eats may give the animal consump-
tion, and she in turn may distribute the seeds o the disease through her milk or flesh to the huma family. People of robust health and strong con-
stitution may escape the contagion, but the pro-
portion of those liable to it under these circum-
stances is very large. The statement was mad by one of the leading members of the conferenc that over a fifth of the population of the worl dies of tuberculosis. The congress did not discus so much the subject of the cure of the disease a the features of its origin and prevention. Th central lesson of the meeting is summed up in th warning to "Beware of saliva, cook your mea right, and boil your milk thoroughly." Con-
sumptives should not be shut up in close or ill-
ventilated rooms, but should sleep with ope windows and take all the fresh air possible Various remedies have boen suggested, but the are at best palliatives, and yet the doctors wer careful to have it stated in the published report of their proceedings that they do not say that th disease is incurable. The revivifying and cura-
tive virtues of open air life, night and day, in  suitable and mild climate, are said to be wonder-
ful. The air should be dry and bracing, and th food wholesome and nourishing.—Baltimore Sun Infection From Books The American Analynt has, on several occasions,
called attention to the disease-carrying qnalities o many of the books in our circulating libraries These volumes passing through a multitude o hands, become in time soiled and ultimately im-
pregnated with dirt to such an extent as to ofte render them repulsive to the eye and correspond-
ingly offensive, if not dangerous, to handle There is a wide-spread impression that librar books, after reaching this stage, are potent ve-
hicles of disease germs, and the managers of man public libraries in Europe have introduced meas-
ures for disinfecting them. Wo have not heard o any of our American libraries having adopted sim-
ilar precautionary measures, though we know o institutions of that kind in this city which sen hooks out through the community whose appear-
ance suggests a bonfire as the only means o cleansing them. For the information of our
American librarians wo will describe the manne in which the manager of the free library in Dun-
dee, Scotland, disinfects books which make thei way back to the library from quarters of the cit in which the sanitary inspector may report the ex-
istence of some infectious di*ease. Dpon the re-
ceipt of the report notice is at once sent to th&
residents of the designated quarter having book out to retain them until further orders. Whe these books are returned to the library they ar thoroughly disinfected. The apparatus used con-
sists of a sort of closed cupboard made of ordi-
nary tinplate with a lid at the top, a wire shel half way up and a little door at the foot. Whe the hooks are returned the lid of the apparatus i opened, and the books placed on their edges, wit the leaves opened out as much as possible on th wire shelf. The lid is closed, and a sulphur pas-
tille is lit and put in at the little door on the tray In a few minutes the sulphurous fumes penetrat between the leaves, effectually destroying germ of disease, if such exist. It is only £air. however,
to state that the opinion is by no means unani-
mously entertained that books are competent t spread infectious diseases. The municipal author-
ities of Dresden, in Saxony, recently had a thor-
ough experimental investigation of this questio conducted. A number of much-used volume from the town library were taken for the purpose The dust from the leaves and covers were sown i nutrient media and cultures reared, the resul being that no microbes belonging to infections dis-
eases were found—the dust being, in fact, nothing-
but ordinary dust of a harmless character. Again,
the dirtiest leaves in the books were rubbed firs with the dry finger and then with the wet. finger In the first case scarcely any microbes were foun on the finger; in the second case plenty wer found, but all appeared to be of a non-infectiou character. Especially is it noted that there wer no tubercle bacilli. Lastly, books were soaked fo two days in spirit containing 10 per cent, of car-
bolic acid. This treatment destroyed all th bacilli, and proved harmless to the volumes. Th conclusion arrived at was that the danger of circu-
lating libraries spreading infection is very slight;
but a recommendation is given to dust books wel before reading them, and never to wet the finge in the mouth for the purpose of turning over th leaves. For our own part we believe the Dunde librarian's precautions to be more wisely founde than the Dresden officials' deductions.--Amerimn
Analyst Nature's Disinfectant The discovery of oxygen in 1774, by Priestley,
the school-master and divine, is an event secon to none other in the annals of science, when esti-

istry and physiology, and upon the life and avoca-

builds and it pulls down. To tell all its wor would be to write a treatise upon chemistry, s numerous are its compounds, so important th processes to which it is necessary. Oxygen is, i truth, the chief of disinfectants. It is furnishe freely and in inexhaustible quantities by the at-
mosphere. When fresh air is named or used as  purifier, it is oxygen that does the work, for th atmosphere is a gaseous ocean, enveloping sea an land to a height variously estimated at from fift to three hundred miles, complex in its chemica composition, and constantly acted upon by light,
heat, and electricity. Among all the strange an interesting occurrences unceasingly wrought ou in its bosom, none is more worthy of notice tha the purifying action of oxygen. Rasping, biting,
filing, it eats out and renders harmless all sub-
stances harmful to life exposed to its action. I the long list of costly, cumbersome, and of stinking disinfectants, uoue excel and but on equals * oxygen in decomposing and purifyin efficacy. It is worth a thousand-fold the whol complicated series, and one-tenth the time spen by our children in repeating the multiplicatio table would put the wholo community in the wa of utilizing its priceless value, and increase th public wealth by untold millions.—Exchange Meat Inspection Necessary Only healthy animals should be used for food i a fact which has long been demonstrated to th most super6eial observer The signs of health are: The animal move about and appears lively, by applying gentle pres-
sure on the loins it does not evince pain, the eyo are clear and bright, the hair is glossy and th skin has a pliant feel, the body well formed an nourished, digestion, assimilation and ruminatio well carried on After skinning the animal we should not fin boils, tumors nor spots of extravasted blood in th sub-cutaneous areola tissue. The meat should b firm and have the characteristic rose color. O opening the chest, there should be no putrid, ba smelling exudations, no tubercles, no whit patches or ulcers, no difference in color, and n disease in the surroundings of the lungs In the stomach and intestine, we should find n red spots, soft, gray or black patches, no dr black remains of the food In the human being many of the most malig-
nant diseases are caused by eating diseased meat At Naples in 1617 over sixty thousand person died from eating the meat of animals that had die of malignant murrain. The same grevious mur-
rain that affect our cattle to this day, iu all trop-
ical and semi-tropical climates Dr. Most cites the following cases: A man con-
tracted a malignant fever and died after saltin the meat of an ox which had been sick with mur-
rain.
A family died after eating the meat of a ho which had been sick with angina In Marburg, Steirmark, several persons died o hydrophobia, who had been eating meat from cat-
tle which had been bitten by a mad dog. (Jour-

produces the taenia solium, or common tapeworm It is said that mutton affected with distom hepaticnm, when used for food, produces echino-
coccus in mankind, nionkies, equine and all rumi-
nating animals. Mutton affected with variol ovina, produces sickness, diarrhrea and fever Meat of any kind, when kept iu a fresh stat until decomposition takes place, poisonous anima alkaloids form, known as ptomains, which canno be destroyed cither by thorough cooking or drying,
and when used for food they produce very grea irritation of the stomach and bowels, followed b uausea, vomiting, purging and great prostration To avoid poisoning or parasitic infection fro meat always procure fresh, wholesome meat an thoroughly cook it. The cooking process will de-
stroy the life of the parasitic embryo and rende them harmless If the living eggs of the human tapeworm ar fed to young bovine animals, in the course o time the animals become infected with the cycti-
cerus referred to above, and if they are used fo food, aud the meat not thoroughly cooked, th tapeworm is reproduced in man.—Flarius J Smith, I). V. S.
A new institute for the practical study of sani-
tary science has been organized at Rome. Origi-
nal research in sanitary subjects will receive gov-
ernmental aid through the Italian National Boar of Public Health. The school will have authorit to giant diplomas to those who successfully pursu a full course of study. The institute will be unde the direction of Dr. Paglioni, now Professor of

STATE BOAlU) OF HEALTH BULLETIN Australian Health Society The Australian Health Society has hcen ill ex-
istence twelve years. The objects of the Societ are: (1) to create and educaie public opinion wit regard to sanitary matters in general, by the ai of the platform, the press, and other suitabl means; (2) to induce aud assist people, by per-
sonal influence, example and encouragement t live in accordance with recognized laws, whoreb health is maiutained and disea-e prevented; (3) t seek the removal of all noxious influences delete-
rious to the public health, and to influence an facilitate legislation in that direction. It is sus-
tained by members who pay five shillings a year An interesting feature is the meetings for wive and daughters. A series of lectures are given b women, the topics being in the usual orthodo line—circulation und respiration; the skin; clean-
liness; nursing the sick; cooking; dress; acci-
dents, etc. The Society has a large and well pat-
ronized library, free to the members of the So-
ciety.—Medical and Surf/teal Reporter Measles in Negroes Dr. Lachlan Tyler, of Washington, lately rea an interesting paper on measles before the Wash-
ington Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society American Journal of Obstetrics. He thitiks that
Ellis is in error in giving the average mortality o the disease as one in fifteen, and that it, is muc lower. Among the negroes of the District of
Columbia, who make up not more than a third o the population, the mortality, he says, is both rel-
atively and actually greater than among th whites. This, lie thinks, plainly demonstrates th potency of insanitary environment iu producin death from measles, for the negroes generally liv in the utmost squalor.—The New Tori- Medical
■Journal Diphtheria from Birds and Other Animals It has been known for some years that birds an poultry are subject to a disease which correspond to what in the human being is known as diph-
theria. Several foreign observers have gone  step further, and have endeavored to show tha the disease is capable of transmission fro animals to human beings. Last year Dr. Turne drew up an interesting report for the local govern*
ment board, bearing on this alleged transinissibil-
ity, and he adduced a large number of observa-
tions which seemed to indicate a connection be-
tween a diphtheritic affection, not only iu fowls, bu in rabbits aud cats, and a similar affection in man The report compared several instances iu whic the "strangles" in horses appeared to give rise t a like train of symptoms. In a thesis by Dr Menzie, the transmission of the disease from ani-
mals to man is attributed to the dejections of th former. Diphtheritic affection among fowls ar very common iu Italy, and he quotes an instanc iu which four out of five children of a medica man were attacked and died. In this case he in-

REPORT FOR NOVEMBER, 1888 The features for November were the large per-
centage of cloudiness and a higher degree of tem-
perature than usual for the month. There wa very little electrical disturbances, and few hig winds The mean temperature was 49 .1. about two
-degrees above the November mean of the si years past, nnd the highest during that perio since 1883. The highest local mean was 52°.2,
recorded at Austin, aud the lowest was 40°.7, re-
corded at Lawrenceburg. The maximum temper-
ature observed was 86°, on the 2d at Waynes-
boro, and was two degrees higher than the maxi-
mum observed in October, and was the highest
November maximum by four degrees during th six 3~ears past. The minimum temperature ob-
served was 19°, on the 27th at Hohenwald, an on the 28th at Lawrenceburg : this was the highest
November minimum during the period abov mentioned. The maximum of temperature wa generally recorded m the Eastern division on the
7th: iu the Middle division ou 1st. 2d. 7th, an in the Western division ou the 1st. The minimu of temperature whs generally recorded on the
27th. The ranges of temperature were les than usual for November. There were two col wave warnings—the 9th and lGth—both of whic were verified, and proved of great benefit. At
Olarksville. in the first instance, the temperatur fell from (54° to 38°, and iu the second it fell

from 56- to 32°. Other stations report similar re-
sults The mean depth of rainfall was -1.38 inehes—
the greatest November mean for the past si years, except in 1886, when it measured tw inches more. The greater part of this full durin the first decade, and the remainder during th second. From the 6th to the 9th the rainfall wa very heavy in the Middle and Western divisions,
and from the 14th to the 20th the rains, thoug light, were almost continual throughout I he State The greatest monthly rainfall was 6.53 inches, at
Memphis, and the least was 2.35 inches, at
Greeneville. The greatest local daily rainfall was
2.74 inches, at Chattanooga on the 8th. The nex greatest was 2.20 iuches, at Savannah on the 6th,
and 2.00 inches on the same day at McKenzie The heaviest rains full on the 6th and 8th, fro one to two inches being reported at most of th stations on those two days. The day of th greatest rainfall was the 8th. when the fall aver-
aged considerably more than an inch for the entire
State. The rain of the 6th, which was confine to the Middle and Western divisions, average also more than one inch for the territory on whic it fell. The other days of heavv rainfall were the
9th, 14th, 15th, and 19th. Of the amount whic fell during the month, the Eastern division re-
ceived an average of nearly three and three-
fourths inches; the Middle division nearly fou and a half inches, and the Western division a littl more than five inches. Thero were fourteen day on which no measurable rainfall was reported Fogs were variously reported on about fourtee days; dews on three davs, and frosts on thirtee days—those of the 4th. 11th to 13th, 23d to 27t inclusive being reported as killing frosts. A ligh fall of snow was reported in the northeastern por-
tion of the State on the 27th and 29th—not suffi-
cient to measure. Sleet was reported at only on station, on the 29th The prevailing winds were north and northeast

ary 8 and 9, 1889 The Board met pursuant to law on Tues-
day, January ist. There being no quoru present, it adjourned to meet on Tuesday,
January 8th. Accordingly the Board me at 11 a. m. January 8th Present—J. D. Plunket, President; Da-
vid P. Hadden, P. D. Sims, Daniel F Wright, and J. M. Safford Absent—G. B. Thornton and p. W. Cole The minutes of the last meeting of the
Board—October i6th—were ordered rea by the Secretary, which was done. The were, upon motion, approved The Secretary then read the following re-
port:
Okkick State Board op Health,
Nashville, Jan. 8, 1889 Or. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health:
Sir—By reference to the "Acts of the State of
Tennessee passed by the Forty-Third General As-
sembly," it will be seen that nearly pix years ago
.. 6.
action was taken in regard to the unsanitary con-
dition of the state-house. On page 418 of the
"Acts" appears the following joint resolution:
"Be it resolved by Ihe General Assembly o the State of Tennessee, That the State Board of
Health be requested to examine into the presen mode of heating and ventilating the capitol build-
ing, and report the effect the same has upon th sanitary condition of the building, and if neces-
sary, in their judgment, to recommend such cor-
rection as may be deemed advisable, and to furthe report some means by which to put the water close in a better sanitary condition."
Approved March 14, 1883 On March 20th the State Board of Health mad a report to the General Assembly urging certai improvements. (See second report of this Board,
pages 32-37) But little improvement has resulted from thi effort. Perhaps because, owing to the near ap-
proach of the end of the session and the pressur upon the treasury of the State at that time, no pe-
cuniary provision was made for the same As a matter of fact the great State of Tennes-
see, with an industrious and enlightened popula-
tion of nearly two million souls, and with a cli-
mate and resources envied by all, does house it high executive officials, its legislators, and its ju-
diciary in a grand and noble structure, destitute o the first elements of a comfortable and health habitation That this statement is too weak and not exag-
gerated will appear from the most casual inspec-
tion of the structure by any one familiar wit comfortable and healthy edifices My attention has been called to it—not fro personal observation at first, for long familiarit with the splendid structure had made me indif-
ferent to its obvious and dangerous defects,—ba from incidents given by its occupants for a serie of years There can be no doubt that the lives of individ-
ual members of the Supreme Court, of executiv functionaries, and of the General Assembly hav been shortened by exposure to the dangers of the

  p. 108 (#282)                       108
STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Capitol, resulting from bad ventilation and defect-
ive heating. Equally truo is it that many offi-
cials and others having business at the state-hons have suffered much loss of health by the same During the sessions of the General Assembly an of the Supreme Court very many persons from al portions of the State who are here for a few day go home, become invalids, and are lost sight o as owing their illness to the sanitary defects of the
Capitol Five minutes exposure to damp walls or t searching drafts have, in a multitude of recorde cases, resulted in long continued illness or i death. The occurrence of such dangers in our
Capitol must produce like effects as in all othe parts of the earth. Beyond question since thi splendid structure iras erected very many person have been injured by the gross oversight or neg-
lect of its sanitary effects. The difficulty has bee that, in the great majority of cases, the parties ar evanescent—here to-day, gone to-morrow. Henc the aggravated character of the nuisance has bee overlooked. Were this building a school-house o an asylum which the inmates occupied all th time, such defects would not be allowed for a day,
as is shown by the liberal, complete, and splendi equipment* furnished by the State of Tennesse for the heatingi ventilating, and draining of it three immense Asylums for the Insane and It schools for the Blind and for the Deaf and
Dumb. The contrast between the sanitary outfi of tho state-house, and that of each of these Stat charities is most striking. For the latter all th resources of modern science have been called int requisition without regard to cost. For the for-
mer nothing has been done. The Capitol, archi-
tecturally a noble copy of the classic Greek, is, fo living purposes, worse than a barn The remedy is simple. The General Assembl now in session should at ouce have plans and spec-
ifications for the needed improvements furnishe by competent experts, get bids for the same fro reliable contractors, and appropriate the su needed in the premises The year 1888 has been marked by tho occur-
rence of small-pox within the State for tho firs time since 1885, the years 1886 and 1887 havin elapsed without a single caso. The large cities of
Memphis and Nashville, and also the populou counties of Obion and Kntherford, were invade and threatened with great damage. Prompt ac-
tion on the part of the proper officials averte the danger, and in eaoh locality the plague wa stamped out with comparatively small expens and loss of life. The number of cases reporte for the year were 66; deaths, 6 The great event of the past year was the ont-
break of yellow fever in Florida, the occurrenc of which was fully foretold in my report of Jan.
3, 1888, and indeed was generally anticipated b students of epidemics throughout America. Th thorough isolation of the entire State was a wor requiring promptness and sagacity. It was per-
fectly done, and gave great satisfaction to all ou people, especially to those residing in such por-
tions of Tennessee as in 1873. 1878, and 1879 ha suffered from this pestilence. To the outsid world it was a demonstration that Tennessee ca be kept absolutely free from this product of th tropics and filth. The value in all points of vie of this demonstration can scarcely be placed to high For the coming year reports received from other
State Boards of Health show that small pox i still prevalent or occurring iu mauy localities Hence the attention of all our local Hoards and o the medical profession was pointedly directed i the December number of the Bulletin to the ne-
cessity of guarding against inroads of this loath-
some disease by the recognized prophylactic—vac-
cination As to yellow fever we must not conceal the fac that the outlook is ominous. All sanitarians in the
Southern States familiar with the past are very un-
easy about the coming summer. There is but on way open to us. namely, to look the possibilitie fairly in the face and be ready for any emergency In this connection a local matter of great impor-
tance should not be overlooked. The four cities—
Memphis, Nashville. Chattanooga, and Knoxville—
each centers of great travel and traffic, visited b thousands annually, not only from Tennessee, bu from States near and far, with large floating pop-
ulations, should, without delay, provide suitabl accommodations for the care and treatment of per-
sons suffering from communicable diseases—ordi-
narily termed contagious or infectious. Such hos-
pitals should be isolated, but not at too incon-
venient a distance. They need not bo large, bu should he always equipped and ready for use, an competent physicians and nurses constantly re-
tained for service. No one can tell when suc hospitals will be wanted. These four cities ar already noted and populous, rapidly growing also,
and arc without excuse for not making such pro-
vision lor the stranger within their gates or thei own people, many in number, who cannot be wel cared for at home Herewith is appended a list of the contribution to the library during the past quarter:

J. IlKKRlRN LlKDSLKT, M.'D.,
Sfcre tury Report laid over to come up later in th meeting Dr. D. F. Wright, Chairman of the Com-
mittee on School Hygiene, reported that a yet the practical workings of the recentl introduced Ruttan heating, ventilating, an dry closet system into the public schools of
Clarksville could not be -as fully stated as h desired, and that therefore he would ask fo further time, and together, at some tim soon, he would present a supplementary re-
port upon the public schools of Nashville,
Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis, and sev-
eral other points in the State Dr. Plunket inquired what had been th result obtained with the Ruttan system in
Dyersburg, where it had been introduce some three or four years ago Dr. Wright replied that since six month after it had been introduced there he ha heard nothing; at that time it was very sat-
isfactory Dr. P. D. Sims moved that Dr. Wrigh be requested to make a tour of personal in-
spection of the public schools of the State,
and that the Executive Committee be au-
thorized to issue him such instructions i furtherance of said object as, after consulta-
tion with him, might seem necessary. Car-
ried Prof. J. M. Safford, Chairman of the
Committee on Water Supply, stated that a an early date he would present a full repor upon the water supply (artesian wells) of
Memphis Dr. Plunket said the question had bee raised in the minds of the people of Nash-
ville (a) as to what would be the sanitar effect upon the water supply or upon th healthfulness of Nashville of constructin the lock and dam, as contemplated, on the
Cumberland River just below the city, an also (£) as to what will be the effects of th filtration upon the water supply of Nashvill as proposed by the island filter; will it wholesomeness be diminished or increase thereby. Since these questions have bee raised it is proper that they should be scien-
tifically answered, and to that end he move that Dr. Safford be requested to make th proper investigation and report the result a as early a day as practicable Dr. P. D. Sims, Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Prisons, stated that the county of
Davidson and the city of Nashville are tak-
ing steps to induce the Legislature to re-
move the penitentiary without the limits o the city. Owing to the unsanitary condi-
tion of the prison and its utter unfitness i every regard for the purposes for which it i intended and the impracticability of its im-
provement, this Board has long and earn-
estly urged its removal, and is ever ready t co-operate with any movement to that end By the sale of the present site, which is no valuable city property, a suitable and de-
sirable country place could be secured an leave, it is believed, a large balance to b used in the erection of a new prison. Muc of the old material would be available; add-
ing to these resources the labor of a larg class of the prisoners, the whole change ca be effected with little or no cost to the State,
giving protection to the capital city of the
State from what is now a constant menac to her health and safety, and giving to the
State a healthful prison instead of what i now a place reeking with poison and wit death, and which would be but a charne house but for the most admirable manner o its management The Board adjourned to meet on Wednes-
day, the 9th inst., at io a. m.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Dr. Plunket, Chairman of the Committe on Meteorology, reported that the commit-
tee's endeavor has been to make this featur of the Board's work as valuable to all inter-
ests in the State to which the weather ha special application as possible, in additio to the careful compilation of meteorologica facts, month by month, as they exist in Ten-
nessee. This data would at the proper tim be utilized in deducing generalizations upo the delightful climate possessed by Tennes-
see, and its unsurpassed advantages woul be published to the world. Since Octobe i st seven new voluntary meteorological sta-
tions had been added to the list, viz.: Jacks-
boro, Campbell County; Springdale, Clai-
borne County; Leeville, Wilson County;
Franklin, Williamson County; Sewanee,
Franklin County; Lookout Mountain, Ham-
ilton County, and Clarksville, Montgomery
County. All these stations have good ob-
servers, and all give promise of great use-
fulness in the collection of meteorologica data, which without them would be lost While a few of the older voluntary observ-
ers have been somewhat irregular of late i reporting, still, with the continued faithful-
ness of the great majority of the old observ-
ers and the new ones, the average numbe of monthly reports has been kept up, an the last month shows a decided improve-
ment in the promptness and excellence o reports. There is yet much valuable terri-
tory in the State to be covered by voluntar stations, and in view of the increasing in-
terest throughout the State in meteorology,
it is hoped that a greater portion of this ter-
ritory will be covered during the presen year. The United States Chief Signal Offi-
cer has always generously aided this servic to the extent of his authority, and promise to continue to aid us so far as it is possible His hearty co-operation in the work and th increasing interest manifested among ou own people lead to the belief that this yea will be the most prosperous and importan since the establishment of the service in the
State. It may be proper to add that th great drawback in the establishment of ne stations is the lack of instruments for mak-
ing the proper observations. With thes supplied, there will be little trouble in secur-
ing new stations at all needed points Judge Hadden, Chairman of the Commit-
tee on Inland Quarantine, made a verba report, in which he urged the importanc and value of scientific quarantine when epi-
demics threatened invasion Dr. Plunket, Chairman of the Committe on Vital Statistics, stated that after carefu work and consultation with a number o leading citizens of the State, he had pre-
pared a bill providing a system of registra-
tion of births, marriages, and deaths in Ten-
nessee. This he would place at once i the hands of some member of the Legisla-
ture to be offered for the consideration o that body, and an earnest effort would b made to have it enacted into law. In thi connection he presented a communicatio from the Medical Society of Montgomery
County, pledging active co-operation in th effort to pass such a bill The Secretary's report was then taken up^
and that portion of it referring to the unsan-
itary condition of the Capitol building wa reread Drs. Safford and Plunket discussed a some length the necessity for certain im-
provements to be made, but urged tha whatever was done, even if a beginning wa only made, that it be done upon a compre-
hensive plan, which, first, should be care-
fully prepared under the direction of this
Board by experts Judge Hadden offered the following reso-
lution:
Hesolreti, That the attention of the General A s-
sembly be called to the pressing necessity of im-
proving the sanitary condition of the Capitol b systematic ventilation, heating, and drainage of"
the building upon the most improved plans as may-
be indicated after a careful survey shall have bee made by experts Seconded by Dr. Sims and unanimousl adopted The Secretary was directed to transmit

ate letter Dr. Safford in the chair, President Plunke read the following communication:
Office Board of Health,
State of Louisiana Xbw Orleans, Dec, 20, 1888 Dr. .1. I). I'lunket, President Tennessee State Boar of Health, Nashville, Term.:
Dkar SiR--The prevalence of yellow fever i a large number of towns in Florida iu the year
1888, following upon the existence of circum-
scribed centers of infection in that State in 1887,
the undisputed hibernation of the disease in som portion of the State, arc reasons for the belief tha the occurrences of 1888 may be repeatod in 1889 The energetic measures of disinfection now be-
ing practiced in some parts of that State will un-
doubtedly do much to lessen the probabilities of  redevelopment of the disease, but can hardly b expected to remove the danger entirely The quarantine systems imposed against Florid by several of the States during the past seaso were independent and separate in their action be-
yond tho interchange of assistance and courtes customary among reputable and responsible au-
thorities, and the appearance of the disease in De-
catur. Ala., and Jackson, Miss., and other places,
presumptively brought from Florida, showed tha the restrictions imposed upon communication fro infected to healthy centers were insufficient i their operation In view of the above recited facts, 1 venture t suggest that a conference be held between th health authorities of the States most exposed t danger of infection from Florida to take unde consideration the organization of a co-operativ and efficient quarantine service, and to arrange fo its details should the necessity for such arise.
I respectfully request your opinion of—
1. The advisability of this conference.
2. The date of which, if advisable, such confer-
ence should meet.
3. The place where such conference should b held
I will send this letter to the health authoritie of Texas. Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, South
Carolina, North Carolina, and tho prominent local
Board of Health of Western Florida, that of Pcu-
sacola; also to the Governors of Georgia and
Florida, neither of which States have other tha local boards, with a request that each of them, i in accordance with their views of public policy,
send an accredited delegate Should a sufficient number of the representative of the various bodies unite in recommending th holding of the conference, that place and that dat fixed upon by the majority will be announced an the invitation issued for the assembly, as being a the request of those approving of such meeting.
I respectfully suggest that Jacksonville itsel might not be an inappropriate place of meeting,
and the date should be previous to the 1st day of
March, 1889 An;answer is urgently solicited Verv respectfully,
C. P. Wilkinson, M. D. President Louisiana State Hoard of Health Dr. Plunket moved that, in furtheranc of the suggestions contained in the letter o the President of the Louisiana State Boar of Health just read, this Board do mos earnestly approve of the proposed conven-
tion, to be held at such time and place a may be agreed upon. Adopted Judge Hadden and Drs. Wright and Sim spoke upon the necessity of such a confer-
ence Dr. Sims moved that Dr. Plunket be ap-
pointed the delegate to said conference fro this Board. Adopted Dr. Safford moved that in the event Dr Plunket could not atted Dr. Thornton b appointed alternate. Adopted After examining and approving account the Board adjourned to meet on the first
Tuesday in April, 1889.

of the amount fell on the 9th, Kith, 26th and 31st,
the last being the day of the greatest rainfall dur-
ing the month. It is a coincidence worthy of not that the corresponding duy of the month in th year previous showed the greatest rainfall, but o that day an average of 1.60 inch fell throughou the State, nearly as much as the average for th entire mouth of December in 1888. The greates monthly rainfall at any station was 3.50 inches,
reported at Covington, which station showed als the greatest rainfall in twenty-four hours, 1.50
inch, on the 15th. The least local monthly rain-
fall was 0.60 inch, reported at McKenzie. Excep on the four days above mentioned the rains wer very light. There were ten days reported withou measurable rainfall. Snows were variously re-
ported on nine days; at many of the stations th fall was not sufficient to measure, and it remaine on the ground but a few hours. The greates depth reported was 3.00 inches, at (ireeneville Frosts were variously reported on twenty-seve days, the 10th, 16th, 17th and 31*t beiug reporte free from frost. Most of these were killing frosts Fogs were reported on eight days, and sleet o four days.

inches The following report from Williamsburg, Ky.,
was received through Sergeant L. N. Jesunofsky.
U. S. observer at Nashville: Total rainfall for De-
cember, 1.45 inch; greatest rainfall in fwenty-fou hours, 0.75 inch. 17th; snowfall on the 13th 1.00
inch The annual report accompanying this will b found to contain some valuable and interestin data. The annual reports of Sergt. L. N. Jesu-
nofsky. U. S. Observer at Nashville. Sergt. h. M Pindell, IT. S. Observer at Chattanooga, and Mr Frank K. Fergusson, voluntary observer at Itid-
dleton, will appear in the next monthly report,
for want of space in this It is gratifying to note that, while some of th voluntary stations in the State have been discon-
tinued, there have been added, during the pas year, several new stations with observers wh seem to bo much interested in the advancement o the service in the State, and they give promise o good results iu the collection of meteorologica data from their respective localities, and of addin very materially to the value and the interest an efficiency of the service. While this may be said,
it is but due to those voluntary observers wh have been so faithful in making the records a their respective stations during the past six years—
who have in all these years, or since the establish-
ment of their stations, given their efforts, and tha without any compensation, to advance the caus and progress of meteorology in our State—to giv them the credit and praise which justly beloug t them for whatever of value or importance the ser-
vice iu Tennessee may possess. It may be grati-
fying to them to know that, although they hav done this great and important work without an direct aid, or scarcely any recognition from the
State, their efforts have been appreciated abroad,
and they have made, and are still making a recor which will be highly valued long after they wil have passed away. It is to the voluntary servic throughout the country that one must look for th collection of valuable meteorological data whic otherwise must be lost. It is through the co-ope-
ration of the voluntary service that the National
Signal Service has been enabled to extend th practical benefits of the service to all parts of th country Flood Warnings and Area Overflowed Tablk of Average Height and Extreme Ranges of the Water at Regular and Special River Stations o the Signal Service iu the State for December, 1888:

SUBSCRIPTION,
25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postoffice at Nashville as Second Class Matter Surface Scavengering Fifteen years- ago there was not a per-
manently organized and working Board of
Health in Tennessee. In the Old World,
the great cholera plague of 1830 and follow-
ing years, have waked up the people an the rulers of the more enlightened nation to some extent. Britain took the lead an inaugurated, as a measure for the benefit o the masses, a sanitary reform which has at-
tracted the attention and admiration of th world for its costliness, completeness an good results. For cleanliness of street and back premises, London, with it crowded population of 5,000,000, is  model Democratic America has been tardy i following this example, because with us th time and talent of public men are devote to party interests and not to the welfar of the people. However, Massachusetts,
which has a syftem of local township gov-
ernment, more truly Democratic than an part of the United States, and whose citi-
zens for public spirit more nearly rival thos of ancient Greece than any people of mod-
ern times did, about twenty-five years ago,
under the leadership of a woman and of  publicist, began a movement which ha since rapidly extended over the Union Hence our public are becoming familia with such terms as that at the head of thi article. Local and State authorities ar now compelled to hear their masters wh demand drainage, the removal of night-soil,
of garbage and of street filth. Newspaper and magazines are constantly treating sani-
tary topics. And if the medical professio does not get out of its stupid lethargy, th people will soon be ahead of it in a knowl-
edge of the causes and prevention of dis-
ease If there is one topic which more than an-
other needs the attention of practical sani-
tarians in Tennessee, it is surface scavenger-
ing. This is confidently asserted from re-
peated and careful inspection on foot, of
Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga and
Knoxville, all of which wealthy and grow-
ing cities are lamentably behind in this re-
spect. The suburbs of these cities, in pop-
ulation exceeding that of our second clas cities, are in such poor sanitary condition a to justify their incorporation into the citie of which they are naturally a part no/en volens. It is a settled point in common law,
that no man has a right to be a sanitar nuisance to his neighbor. Decisions o courts recently given to this effect in a great

number and variety of cases, could readil be cited. Just northwest of Nashville,
within a stone's throw of the capitol, is  suburb of about twenty thousand people,
which, if not annexed to Nashville proper,
should at least be required to have a cor-
poration of its own so as to carry out prope sanitary regulations. Indeed there shoul be a general law, we may style it, of sel incorporation, which, corresponding wit nature's fiat, should attach every buildin adjacent or contiguous to an incorporate city or town to said corporation. In Ten-
nessee, and generally in America, all munici-
pal corporations are planned on too lim-
ited a scale. Hence great evils in more re-
spects than one speedily ensue. Nashvill originally included hardly enough acres t make a truck patch. Now its area is  satire upon the word city. Its limits shoul extend by a radius of three miles from the
Maxwell House all around. Thus it woul include space enough for a prosperous an healthy community The want of thorough surface scavenger-
ing is perhaps a greater evil in the small an beautiful towns and villages in Tennessee,
than it is in the large cities above men-
tioned, for these all have well organized an influential Boards of Health, which are con-
stantly pressing sanitation upon the peopl and authorities. Extensive systems o drains and sewers are planned and unde way. Garbage and night-soil services ar at work constantly. So that in these larg cities progress is made more or less rapidl to a more perfect- cleanliness of earth an air. From very extensive observation an correspondence it may be affirmed that th indifference and absolute blindness of th intelligent citizens and rulers of nearly ever beautiful village and town in Tennessee a to the supreme importance of surface scav-
engering is astonishing. In no part of th world has nature done more for the beaut and healthfulness of hamlets, villages an towns, than in West, Middle and East Ten-
nessee. Bolivar, Fayetteville and Morris-
town may be taken as types. One who ha journeyed on horseback, on foot, on the rail,
repeatedly between the great river and th great mountains, can never sufficiently ad-
mire the capacity of dear old Tennessee a the site for innumerable villages with school and churches, with homes and workshops,
for beauty and comfort more than rivalin those over which the tourists from the Sout go into raptures when traveling in the Nort or in Europe Yet when cholera and yellow fever invad the land, it is the smaller towns and ham-
lets which suffer most. This fact is an inde as to relative sanitary condition and shoul do away with the prevailing error that th small towns are healthier than the larg cities. And as time goes on the great cities,
always improving their water supply an perfecting their daily sanitary work, will be-
come more and more healthy, while th country towns neglecting surface scavenger-
ing will become receptacles of night-soil, de-
caying garbage and other filth. Inevitabl in due time the contaminated and poisone soil will impart its noxious properties to th wells and springs from which the inhab-
itants draw their water supply. Then fare-
well to any and all pretentions to healthful-
ness, and resultant pecuniary damage be-
yond computation Look at Franklin, at Gallatin, at Union
City, at Johnson City, at each and all of ou rural towns, and what do we see, but th same condition of things which, going on in
Memphis for some fifty years finally culmi-
nated in the violent explosionsof 1873, 1878
and 1879. Inevitably like effects will fol-
low upon a similar scale from like neglect,
whether the town has five hundred, fiv thousand, or fifty thousand people. Forth-
with, not from any scare as to yellow feve or any other epidemic, but in deference t the immutable laws of health, the peopl inhabiting a contiguous or adjacent set o houses should institute a surface scavenger-

ing service by which night-soil should b prevented from permeating the soil and b frequently removed, the streets and alley kept neat and free from filth, and all garbag either utilized or destroyed by fire before be-
coming offensive. All which would requir but a few hundred dollars per annum in  small community, though in cities man thousands are cheerfully expended in thi line. In Tennessee the rural towns are fa too sleepy in regard to sanitary reform an progress. Our cities are waking up—rathe slowly Lesson Not Lost The Governor of Florida has called  special session of the Legislature to con-
sider measures for protecting the publi health, and especially to take steps fo establishing a State Board of Health. I will for long years to come be matter of re-
gret with the people of Florida that, fro inexcusable supineness or lethargy, he chosen rulers did not listen to the warning of danger loudly given long before th summer of 1888. Had Florida been read to help herself much obloquy from neigh-
boring States would have been saved. Al these had just reason for complaint Again, an efficient State Board of Healt would have been invaluable as a mediu through which the assistance of the Federal
Government could have been used. Ther can be no doubt that the efficiency of thi liberal and cordial aid would have been in-
creased ten-fold by this species of co-
operation.
A Note for Nashville The London Lancet says: "In his admir-
able report upon the mortality in Englan and Wales during the ten years, 187 i-'8o,
Dr. William Ogle devoted considerabl space to the consideration of the mortalit from phthisis and diseases of the respirator organs in what he terms "dust - inhalin occupations." His figures bear a heav record against the dust of stone and th dust of metal.''
If there is any one annoyance speciall complained of in Nashville it is that result-
ing from the impalpable powder or dust int which the priable limestone composing th roadbed of the streets is ground. Washing-
ton City used to be as bad, but its splendi street improvements have done away wit the evil. So great is this evil that to live in
Nashville may be well styled, "a dust-in-
haling occupation" There can be n doubt that this frequent inhaling of ston dust is the cause of many lung diseases in
Nashville. So much the more reason fo the constant and thorough cleaning of th streets, specially the central and crowde thoroughfares. Instead of there being in-
tervals of days and sometimes of weeks i this surface scavengering, these street should be swept every night. Indeed, as  material for the central streets, limeston should long since have been abandoned River gravel, even, would be a great im-
provement Schools and Vaccination Small-pox occurred in January in som seven or more localities in Ohio. At an time we may hear of it in as many localitie in Tennessee, whence, without extrem vigilance and prompt action, it would soo become as frightful an evil as of recen years it has been in'Louisville, Philadelphi and Montreal. The large cities in Ten-
nessee have a regulation which, if adopte by every municipal corporation in the
State, would go far to protect quite a num-
ber at least in each county. Reference i had to the ordinance which prevents an child from being received into the publi schools without a certificate of vaccinatio from a physician. Of course, 'privat schools would soon fall into line. Henc in these larger towns vaccination is far more

in vogue than in country districts. Ther is no reason why even the smallest chartere town should not enforce such an ordinance Also, there is no reason why the heads o schools anywhere in Tennessee should not,
out of regard to their pupils, require certifi-
cates of vaccination from each child. Th law of the State should forbid any on from belonging to any public school with-
out such certificate Membranous Croup Dr. J. F. Kennedy, Secretary of the
Iowa State Board of Health, enforces quar-
antine as rigidly in all cases of membranou croup and diphtheritic croup, so called, a the pronounced diptheria. He thinks tha the practical effect of isolation and disin-
fection in all such cases would not only re-
strict the spread of membranous croup, bu also lessen the number of cases of diph-
theria.
A Plea for the Inspection of Cattle, Mea and Milk in the Markets of
Tennessee By Daniel F. Wright, M. D.,
Member of State Board of Health, Clarksville, Tenn The object of food inspection has as-
sumed an importance and urgency in th present day far beyond what it has demand-
ed at any former period, and I desire thi paper to be looked upon as an appeal fo immediate legislation on a matter not les threatening to the community than was th epidemic whose invasion we escaped s narrowly and with such active exertions las fall In the first place the knowledge of anima diseases and of their communicability t man has attained a copiousness and precis-
ion in the present day such as has neve been attempted till now. It was one o these cattle diseases named "anthrax," or
"splenic fever," which was the occasio with the celebrated Pasteur of entering o those studies of the microscopic germs o disease which have issued in his hands an those of others in the creation of a new de-
partment of pathology, entitled micro biology,
which has already been fruitful of inestima-
ble benefits in the treatment and prevention-
of human and animal diseases. Anthrax,
however, though not unknown in this coun-
try, is less prominent here than severa monia, foot and mouth disease renderpes other animal diseases, such as pleuro-pneu-
monia, foot and mouth disease, rinderpest o cattle plague, and lastly tubercle, more com-
monly known as scrofula Although all these diseases are of vas importance as contaminating our meat sup-
ply, this paper will be confined to the con-
sideration of the last mentioned, both be-
cause it is a more direct cause of disease i the human family, and because it is a mor imminent menace to the public health a this particular time Tubercle in cattle is the same disease a tubercle in man; it is in both the substanc characteristic of consumption when foun in the lungs, and it is not only common to-
man and the lower animals but is commun-
icable from the one to the other Tubercle is communicable from cattle t man through the breath of tuberculous ani-
mals, more directly so through eating thei flesh when insufficiently cooked (which i the fashionable way of eating beef in th present day), still more so by consumin the milk of tuberculous cows. It woul appal some mothers of families did the know the vast number of cows thus infecte which are now supplying nourishment t their children. It is among milch cow that the disease is specially prevalent, i older cows more so than heifers and mos so in cows confined the year round (as the are in cities) in stables with insufficient an insalubrious food. This progressive preva-
lence of tubercle in milk cows has bee made the subject of statistical report in Ba-
varia, as follows. We quote from an ad-
dress delivered by Dr. Klophel of Memphis,
before the International Grange Associatio and the Butchers' Protective Association:
In 1877 there were found in Bavaria
4,976, and in 1878 5,052 tuberculous cattle,
the former number being 1.62 per cent, an the latter 1.61 per cent, of all the cattle,
sound and unsound, in that country; but th relative prevalenceof the disease at differen ages and sexes renders the statement muc more significant. It prevails much mor in females than in males, and in the forme more and more with advancing age. Her is the specification of tuberculous cattle ac-
cording to age.

affected with tuberculous disease But this presents very inadequately th probable prevalence of tuberculous diseas in the great dairy sheds of our cities. In th first place, the enumeration was taken in
Bavaria, so as to iuclude the whole nation,
town and country, and without distinctio of sex, whereas it is known that the diseas is much more prevalent among cows tha among bulls or oxen, and very largely s among cows confined in city sheds and sta-
bles over'those on farms in the country,
though even there, if large numbers are kep in crowded sheds or barns the same troubl arises as in town. On both these kinds, w must add something in detail which pos-
sesses a terribly practical bearing in thi country First, then, tubercle prevails much mor among females than among males of the bo-
vine race. This may be briefly dismissed It need only be stated that the Bavaria veterinaries found tuberculous cows to b three times as numerous as bulls and oxe similarly diseased Second, as to the infinitely greater preva-
lence of tubercle among cows confined in
"byres," as they are called in Scotland,
meaning buildings with stalls for large num-
bers of cows, we must dwell on the observa-
tions of Mr. Dewar, a very eminent Scotc veterinarian who practiced in an extensiv breeding and rearing district. Quite earl in his practice he found a perfect endem-
prevalence of tubercle; he found to hi clismay that he could not cure a single case He came to the conclusion that the buildin in which the animals were confined was to close. He had called in a physician—
practiced on human patients; they mad post mortem examinations and both agree that it was tubercle, and the doctor called it
^////list's pulmonalis, as he would have style it in one of his human patients This was in 1839, at which period the ex-
istence of tubercle in the lower animals
.(except perhaps monkeys), and its infectiou character even in man, were by no mean generally admitted; neither proposition i doubted now However, Mr. Dewar continued his in-
vestigations; and, first, in a therapeuti direction, he tried to cure the disease, usin the methods prevalent in human tubercle His first attention was directed to th buildings. He 'could find no fault i them, except the want of a free circulatio of air. He says "the 'byres' were re-
cently built, and ceiled and plastered like  drawing-room. The proprietor agreed t remove the partition walls and to mak openings opposite one another on the out-
side walls, so that there might be a curren of fresh air passing through." In additio to all this, he used the medicines customar in human tubercular disease, as cod live oil and tonics, which he thinks may hav prolonged life, but not saved it, and event-
ually the whole flock died out. After  thorough cleansing of the building an burning the soiled litter, other animals wer admitted with good result, but constan vigilance was necessary to prevent the ad-
mission of infected animals or even thei offspring, for the heredity of the diseas was now admitted Other employees of his neglected th same precautions, though warned by him (fo he had now a large practice in the district),
but never neglected with impunity, and h says that "soon so many animals wer affected that the byres were infested wit the fearful malady."
I have dwelt more at large upon thes early investigations of the subject, becaus they were the occasion of developing a tid of public opinion on the subject of foo hygiene which has never ebbed, a develop-
ment which*it is earnestly desired to elici in this State Much has been done since. Methods o investigation more rigid and more logica have been applied to the modes in whic the disease is spread to the causes fro which it originates, and some of these wil be here touched on in order to account fo the facts now recognized by all expert occupied with the subject, that bovine tuber-
cle has very largely increased of late in thi country. Let us consider, then, the differ-
ent ways in which such inspection is dis-
tributed It has been found to be spread by th breath, the milk, the flesh and the sputa of

  p. 128 (#302)                       128
STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN.
tuberculous animals, and animals of tuber-
culous parentage are specially predisposed Of infection by the breath of tuberculou animals there is ample proof; the breath o cows, for instance, is found to contain  special abundance of moisture, with whic when thus diseased large quantities o tuberculous matter pass off as fluids are dis-
persed by a doctor's atomiser; it is in thi way that animals confined in badly ventila-
ted sheds so rapidly contract the diseas from one another till a whole herd i affected. Of the milk nothing need b said; no secretion so rapidly absorbs mate-
rial, healthy or morbid, from the genera system as this. Of the flesh when eaten,
'dogs, cats and pigs have answered to th experiments of scientists by abundant evi-
dence of tubercular infection, and the sput or expectorations in the hand, of Gerluch,
Viseur and Tapeiner have given unquestion-
able results. These experimental lesion cannot be. given in detail, but it must b stated that Viseurs' description of th autopsy of a cat thus experimented upo might serve as a graphic description of th intestines and mesenteric glands of huma child dead with tabes mesenterica, of whic the present writer has dissected man specimens From all these considerations, does it no become abundantly evident, even withou the testimony of our experts to its great in-
crease of late, that tubercle once intro-
duced among our cattle, and not combatte by the most stringent methods of repression,
must increase in geometrical progression?
In what was stated about the statistics o the disease in Belgium, it would at firs sight appear that it does not necessarily in-
crease, the percentage is a little smaller in
1878 than in 1877, but this inference van-
ishes with a statement of the facts. Th exposures of 1877 led to a vigorous effor on the part of the government towar stamping out the disease, and thousands o animals were slaughtered and their carcasse destroyed; even so, however, it took year to entirely expurgate the country of it plague Here we have no repressive measures an no statistics, and we only know by genera statements and necessary inference tha tubercle must prevail to a frightful exten among our cattle and among our milkin stock especially.
I have dwelt upon this subject for urgen reasons (this acknowledged increase o tubercle throughout the country in ou herds and dairy establishments), because I
believe we are in danger of. an epidemi which will soon become very difficult, if no impossible, to eradicate, and I want to im-
press upon the people of Tennessee that th establishment of a disease among us in a endemic form is a thing much more to b dreaded than any epidemic. We have ha from time to time very frightful epidemics,
especially yellow fever and cholera, an many among us remember the alarm an terror with which the presence of thes scourges has been regarded; but how if i were to transpire that one or both of thes scourges were established among us in per-
manence, as cholera lingers in the jungle of Hindoostan, or yellow fever on the coast and among the islands of the Carribean
Sea? And yet this is exactly what is i progress of being established in this countr at this time; for bovine tubercle is a diseas which not only is highly infectious, but i one capable of originating without infection,
one which constantly does so originate, an if one tuberculous cow or ox gets into  stable or stock yard, or farm occupied b sound animals, the whole herd is liable to-
be tainted This is the reason why, in preference to-
a great many very malignant cattle epi-
demics, I have selected the endemic tuber-
cle. 1 could have given descriptions o other diseases which we have had amon us, with details to make men shudder; I
could have told of cattle plague, pleur pneumonia, big-jaw or foot and mouth dis-
ease, but, with all their horrors, these ar epidemics and can be stamped out, and tha once done we are rid of them till new case are imported, but with regard to bovin tubercle, exemption from that, like liberty,
has no less a price than eternal vigilance.
I have thus endeavored, in words a plain as I could find for the purpose, to pu forth a warning against what I believe to b a most formidable danger threatening th health of the State, and I am sensible how-
inadequate words are to express the mo-
mentous importance of the subject. O this, however, I am entirely confident tha the facts I have laid before you (and the are but a small fraction of what might b stated were there time enough) need no any rhetorical aid to enlist your most earn-
est consideration.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN There have been three or four eases of jaundice, o which it will be remembered there was almost a epidemic here a year or more ago Gibson county—Dr. T. J. Happel, County
Health Officer, Trenton.—For January I have t report an increased amount of sickness. The gen-
eral type of diseases can be denominated catarrhal-
pneumonia and bronchitis being most common There has so far been but little proportionate fatal-
ity. In two districts adjacent to Trenton, erysip-
elas chiefly of the face and head has prevailed t gome extent. Malarial fevers continue to appea occasionally. The warm, changeable winter i leaving the germs of intermittent and remitten fevers still active. I have had no reports from m county assistants up to date Milan—M. D. L. Jordan. M.D.—Seven cases o scarlatina in town during January; no deaths. A
widespread epidemic of acute-pharyngitis pre-
vailed during the month Trenton—A. S. Currey, Esq.—Slight increase o sickness during mouth, but not more than usua for January. Several cases of pneumonia reported,
but yielding readily to medical treatment. Bron-
chial and catarrhal affections common, and som few oases of whooping congh reported Giles county—Dr. G. A. Abernathy, County

cided increase in the amount of sickness in Crund county. Besides the ordinary winter diseases—
bronchitis, tonsilitis, etc., we have had during Jan-
uary much gastric and diarrhoeal troubles amon children. Some of these cases have been ver severe, though no deaths have been reported.
"With the close of the month there exists severa cases of enteric fever of a mild form. Three sud-
den deaths of young babe, cause unknown, wer reported for the month. East month I reported a epidemic of enteric fever at Sewanee. I lear that this is not strictly true. There was only on oase in Sewanee during the fall. The other case were in a neighborhood two miles from Sewane and were due to local causes Hamblen county—Dr. I). E. Shields. County

Health Officer, Datura.—No report received Hardeman county—Dr. Jas. J. Xeelv. Jr. County Health Officer, Bolivar.—The health of thi county continues unexceptioually good. With th exception of slight catarrhal attacks, there is n sickness worth mentioning. The sanitary condi-
tion of the towns havo been scrupulously looke alter, which has in a great measure prevented dis-
ease, and is the main cause of our exemption fro disease arising from that source. Since the en-

"This January has been the mildest for a decade,
the thermometer ranging from 19° to 65°: winds va-
riable, frequently blowing from every point of th compass within twenty-four hours, until the 23d,
when it veered to northeast and remained station-

25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postoffice at Nashville  s Second Class Matter Look Behind!
An eminent German authority some tim gave as a test for the civilization of a peo-
ple, not their palaces, museums and work of art, but their backhouses. Not a ver stylish test, indeed, but yet a very truthfu one. For the highest proof of civilizatio is valuation of life, and where back prem-
ises are despised life will be shortened All persons who have given much atten-
tion to the inspection of premises are im-
pressed with the singularly unwise contras between the front and rear of city dwelling-
houses. The front rooms of our houses ar generally but little occupied, being used fo show or temporary purposes. The livin uses are mainly in the rear. Yet care, at-
tention and cost are devoted to the front,
while the rear is too often in an unkempt,
desolate state. Just the reverse should b the case. Always use rather than show With us in America it is always show befor use. We lack the English appreciation o comfort. In fact, we hardly have the no-
tion of comfort, and are constantly expend-
ing enormous sums for show and discomfort The money wasted in putting up costly iro fences separating our dwellings from th streets on which they front would go ver far toward redeeming the back yards fro unhealthy nuisances.
A municipal ordinance which forbids al animals from running at large within corpo-
rate limits would save our principal citie many thousand dollars. To our smalle towns such an ordinance would be propor-
tionately beneficial. Some ten years ag such an ordinance was brought to the atten-
tion of the people of Nashville. No on could see any sense in the suggestion. No citizens of Nashville traveling in the new
Northwest, where ideas of progress ar eagerly seized, come home speaking raptur-
ously of the extraordinary beauty of th streets, which, having no palings or fenc-
ings in front of the houses, present a beau-
tiful vista of lawn and shrubs, and allo free circulation of air and sunshine None of our Tennessee towns and citie are very old, yet in each and all many con-
taminated and foul back premises exist Specially is this true of the older and cen-
tral portions. Here may be pointed ou back lots, hid out of sight, which have bee neglected time out of mind. In the cours of twenty, thirty, it may be fifty years, thes lots have become mere masses of reekin filth, giving out emanations quite as noxiou as any sewer gas. And yet right around

these lots many people live day and night—
in summer time with doors and window open—breathing the atmosphere thus foule all the time. Sewer gas! sewer gas!! is a old cry. The books and the journals an the dailies constantly repeat it. The fat of Prince Albert, beloved in Britain, and of
Secretary Manning, honored throughout
America, give point and emphasis to thi everlasting reiteration. And verily sewe gas is no joke, seeing how many houses,
more especially of the wealthy, are poisone by defecive connections of sleeping apart-
ments with city mains. Nevertheless, i our part of the world, nasty earth gas is  far more potent cause of slow recover from illness, or of death when recover should have taken place. Many a tim when the skillful physician has been thwart-
ed in his just anticipations the explanatio would readily appear were back premise explored In many instances these premises, fro long continued neglect, have become so fou that no ordinary surface scavengering wil avail. The soil is saturated with filth t the depth of ten or twelve inches, an should be removed bodily, or else thorough-
ly disinfected Very often, however, great improvemen can be made by removing rubbish, garbage,
and other surface accumulations. All thi work should be done at once. Thus whe the hot weather sets in nothing more will b needed than daily care in preventing fres accumulations Always and everywhere in this beautiful
South-land must be urged the supreme im-
portance of cleanliness, and the beneficia influence of fresh air and sunshine all i and around our living and sleeping rooms God has given us a paradise. Too ofte we make it a pest-house Lack of Local Boards From Rowell's American Newspaper

gence of any character. Each town shoul be in such good sanitary order, and so well

provided with medical and nursing at-
tendance, as to be ready at any time to take
Christian care of a small-pox patient, and t maintain due equanimity of soul even whe cholera or yellow fever are in the land, and,
in spite of all precautions, might drop dow in its midst. Such a state of preparatio will make all diseases go lighter, and pro-
mote recovery and escape from prematur death. This is the proper aim and true re-
ward of sanitary reform Epidemic alarms and realities are occa-
sional and fleeting. Yet the lessons taugh by them have always made a profounde and more lasting impression than the perma-
nent and beneficent results of constant goo sanitary work. And surely no one lesson i more thoroughly and repeatedly taught b such visitations than the vital importance o real sanitation to communities of very lim-
ited population The first great cholera epidemic of 1833
made its mark even more conspicuousl upon Shelbyville and other at that perio very small towns than upon Nashville. Th last terror from this visitant, in 1873, was a much felt in Goodletsville, Gallatin, Mur-
freesboro, Shelbyville, Lebanon, Palmyra,
Farmington, Ooltewah, Greeneville, Erin,
Union City, Clinton, Wallace Cross Roads,
Jonesboro, Elizabethton and Rogersville a in the large cities The yellow fever of 1878 made its mar upon Humboldt, Jackson, Milan, Mason's

no less than Memphis and Chattanooga The world-famous epidemic of typhoi fever of occurred, not in a city, but in Ply-
mouth, a small inland town of Pennsyl-
vania, and led to the establishment of the
Pennsylvania State Board of Health The recent epidemic of yellow fever ha given quite a number of small towns in
Florida a national reputation for shamefu want of cleanliness In view of such facts as the above, whic have now for ten long years been repeatedl pressed upon the attention of the medica profession, the proper guardian of the pub-
lic health, and equally thrust before the eye of all municipal and county authorities in
Tennessee, who are by law invested wit grave responsibilities in this behalf, it i astonishing that so little progress has bee made in organizing local boards of health,
working in unison with the State Board By references to the pages of the Bulle-
tin it will be seen that about seven suc boards make regular reports. It will als be seen that several cities which by the let-
ter or spirit of the law are required to kee full mortuary records and report the same,
have paid no attention to this importan matter, thus doing themselves the injustic of a negative notice of ill-health. This re-
mark applies to every town in the abov list of 2,000 or more, which does not b law require death certificates before burial However, the people are waking up t the axiom that prevention is better tha cure — prophylaxis than therapeutics. I the next few years Tennessee will alig itself with the live Northwest in this vita matter of local sanitation, and thus mak itself worthy of the rich gifts with which i has been endowed by nature The United States Cholera Commissioner About one year ago we alluded to th fact that though Dr. E. O. Shakespeare, of
Philadelphia, had been appointed in th fall of 1885 United States Cholera Commis-
sioner, and did at that time go abroad fo the ostensible purpose of investigatin cholera, then raging in southern Europe,
yet, no report of his mission had ever bee made by him, so far as this board coul learn, and we raised the question why?

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN The riddle, no one in this broad land i seems, has been able to solve, until a fe days ago we were permitted to see the fol-
lowing letter, which establishes the tw points: (a) That E. O. Shakespeare, M. D.,
is a reality, and not a myth; (b) that as soo as the portrait of his highness—the microb can be properly executed, so all may se and know him as he is, the report, it i promised, will be filed with the governmen for publication:
Department of State,
Washington, Feb. 5, 1889 To the Hon. J. E. Washington, House of Repre-
sentatives:
Sir—In reply to your letter of the 30th tilt., in-
quiring iu regard to the appointment, expenditure and report of Dr. E. 0. Shakespeare as represent-
ing the United States Cholera Commission, I hav the honor to inform you that a certificate of ap-
pointment was issued by this department on the
1st of October, 1885, to Dr. E. 0. Shakespeare,
designating him as the representative of the
United States to proceed to Spain and other coun-
tries in Europe where cholera existed. On the 5t of October, 1885, and the 12th of January, 1886,
letters of credit on London were issued iu favor of
Dr. Shakespeare for $2,000 and $1,000, respect-
ively, making an aggregate of $3,000. Dr. Shakes-
peare drew the whole of this amount, but has a yet rendered no account of its expenditure. O the 13th of June, 1887, the department wrote to
Dr. Shakespeare expressing regret at the delay i submitting his report on cholera, and hoping tha it would soon be completed and sent. On the
18th of the same month Dr. Shakespeare replied,
sayiug that he hoped to be able to submit his re-
port in two weeks. Since that date nothing ha been heard from him on the subject officially, bu through private letters received from him it ap-
pears that he found great difficulty in having th drawings made of his microscopic studies of mi-
crobes, which would account for the delay in get-
ting out his report.
I have the honor to be, sir,
Your obedient servant,
T. F. Bayard Now in all kindness, we say if Dr Shakespeare failed to see a case of choler in his jauntings through Europe in 1885, or,
seeing, is unable to tell what he did see, le him frankly say so, and refund to the Gov-
ernment the money expended by him Local Boards The Dominion of Canada, with 3,000,000
of square miles and about 6,000,000 of in-
habitants, occupying the extreme norther portion of our continent, is yet very wid awake as to public health. Each Provinc has a board answering to our State Boar of Health; also laws establishing a complet system of local boards, working in complet harmony with the Provincial or State Board The following excerpts from "the Regula-
tions of the Provincial Board of Health fo the Direction of Local Boards of Health o the Province of Quebec" will be read wit interest and profit by our readers who ar trying to get up local boards in their respect-
ive communities The long-continued summers and the fa denser population of Tennessee would re-
quire some of the details below to be altere in the direction of more rigid sanitation:
organization of local boards of health,
their powers and ddtibs.
2. A Local Board of Health will be organize in each municipality of the Province according t clause 6 of the "Act respecting public health
(1888)." Boards of Health or Health Committee previously organized in virtue of article 607 of the
Municipal Code, or of the town corporation's gen-
eral clauses act, or of a special charter, have  legal existence and have the same powers as the
Boards named according to clause 6 of the Act re-
specting public health.
3. Every Local Board must immediately in-
form the Provincial Board, if it has not alread done so, of the names of its members and officer as well as of any change which may take place o its staff.
4. Each municipality will name a Health Offi-
cer, such Health Officer being a licensed physicia whenever possible.
5 Local Boards will promulgate, execute an cause to be executed the regulations and orders o the Provincial Board and any other sanitary laws-
enacted by Provincial or Federal statutes.
6. Local Boards must verify complaints mad to them of bad sanitary conditions in their localit and take such measures as may be thought prope to have them removed, and in cases not provide for in the present regulations, and especially  cities, they shall have power to make the neces-
sary regulations to that effect.
7. By-laws and regulations of Local Boards,
in any way opposed to those of the Provincial
Board, are hereby suspended.
8. The Health Officer or the Secretary of every
Local Board shall, during the month of Januar in each year, send to the secretary of the Provin-
cial Board a report on the work of his Board for

143
the procediug year and on the present sanitar condition of the municipality.
CBMETKRIES.
9. The Local Boards must see that the sanitar requirements of the law respecting interments an disinterments* are obeyed, and inform the Provin-
cial Board of any infractions of the said law s that the Provincial Board may confer with the ec-
clesiastical authorities and the proprietors of ceme-
teries to have the matter remedied.
10. "Whenever the proper authorities shall hav given their permission for the partial or genera removal of dead bodies from a cemetery, it wil be the duty of the Local Board of the municipal-
ity in which such cemetery is situated to prescrib the precautions to be taken, such as disinfection,
etc., so that disinterments may be made withou danger to public health.
11. The Provincial Board having according t law (51-52 Vict., chap. 48) the power to determin what length of time shall elapse between the in-
terment and the disinterment of persons who hav died from cholera, small-pox, typhoid or scarle fever or diphtheria, it will be necessary to obtai its authorization before disinterring such dead per-
sons, even alter live years have elapsed.
PRIVIES, CES8POOLS AND DRAIN'S.
12. The Provincial Board can only tolerat with regret non-cemented privy pits and mos strongly recommends Local Boards to do all i their power to have them replaced by dry-eart closets, or still better by water-closts, when ther is an aqueduct in the locality.
13. No privy vault, cesspool or other reservoi into which a privy, water-closet, sink or stable i drained, except it is water tight, will be permitte within 100 feet of a well, or other source of wate used for drinking or culinary purposes. The
Local Board may determine a greater distance, i the nature of the soil requires it.
14. Privies shall not be tolerated within twent feet of any dwelling-house.
15. Privies and cesspools when full shall b emptied, and all privies and cesspools, whethe full or not, shall be emptied at least once a yea prior to June 1st or after October 1st. Afte emptying, all privies and cesspools shall be disin-
fected.
16. The connection of privy pits with the pub-
lic sewers is not allowed.
17. When a privy pit is to bo abandoned, i must bo first emptied and disinfected, and the filled in with earth well rammed down.
18. No public or private sewer shall empty int any river or other body of water—used for drink-
ing purposes or for ice supply—the capacity o which is not sufficiently large to prevent th water from being contaminated by it, and when-
ever there exists a doubt, the Provincial Boar shall decide the question.
19. All sewage drains that pass within fift feet of any source of water supply for drinking o culinary purposes, shall be water tight, and in por-
ous subsoil the limit shall be 100 feet. The sam rule applies to drains within fifty feet from dwell-
ings.
''An act for the better regulation of interments and dis-
interments. 51-52 Vict., chap. 48.
HOUSEHOLD REFUSE, WASTE MATTERS, GARBAGE,
ETC.
20. No person shall permit the accumulation i or around the immediate vicinity of any dwelling-
house or premises under his control, of refus matter, such as the remains of animals, fish,
vegetables, bones, carcasses or any kind of offa until decomposition sets in. No stagnant wate shall be permitted in places where it can be in-
jurious to health.
21. In localities where the municipality doe not provide for the removal of garbage, ever householder must burn his own refuse (this can b done in the kitchen stove) or bury it at a reason-
able depth. The Local Board may indicate  place for such deposits.
22. The removal of garbage between May 1s and November 15th must be done once a week a least.
23. On the 1st of May of each year every yard,
cellar and surroundings of the house munt hav been cleaned and any noxious animal aud vege-
table matter removed Yellow Fever The editorial from the Cincinnati Lancet-
Clinic is from the pen of Dr. Thomas C Minor, who in 1878 was Health Officer of
Cincinnati, and personally acquainted wit the behavior of yellow fever in the Ohio
Valley. It calls timely attention to a ver prevalent error respecting the scope of ter-
ritory liable to this pestilence, an erro which in more than one instance has bee followed by very costly and fatal conse-
quences Away With Trash The following Nashville city ordinance,
approved Feb. 22, 1889, while prompte by the Fire Department, yet incidentally i a very important contribution to the publi health. It should be adopted by each mu-
nicipal corporation in Tennessee. It make it unlawful to keep, store or allow to remai any waste paper, straw or other rubbis about premises. If faithfully enforced i will add much to the tidy appearance o the alleys and gutters in the business por-
tions of Nashville:
Section 1. That hereafter it shall be unlawfu for any person, firm or corporation to keep, stor or allow to remain any waste paper, straw, shav-
ings or any other inflammable rubbish of any kin in any back yard, alleyway, area, or in any cellar,
store-house, factory or other building within th limits of the city.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Sec. 2. Any straw, excelsior shaving paper o other papers to be used for packing or for manu-
facturing purposes, shall not be allowed to remai or laid loose about on the premises, but shall b either securely packed or baled or kept in som suitable receptacle or place free from danger fro sparks ot other cause of fire Sbc. 3. Any person, firm or corporation havin charge or control of such building or premises re-
ferred to who shall fail to remove or cause to b removed such rubbish or materials referred to i the two preceding sections within twenty-fou hours after having been notified by the Building
Inspector, Chief of the Fire Department or his as-
sistants, or any police officer, shall be deeme guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction there-
of shall be fined not less than $10 nor more than
$50 for each offense, and $10 for each day suc rubbish or materials are allowed to remain there-
after The Lesson of 1878 As in war the famous campaigns of grea leaders, even in far distant ages and coun-
tries, are to-day studied with intense interes by those military officers who aim for suc-
cess and distinction in their high calling, s in the great contest for prolonging th average life of man we must constantl make use of the grand lessons furnished b the experience of the past. Indeed, this i the common-sense mode by which progres is made in all the pursuits of man For Tennessee the most costly, the sad-
dest, and in all respects the most calamitou experience of evil from neglect or ignoranc of sanitary science took place in 1878. T the people of all West Tennessee the scene of that fearful summer and autumn are stil vividly fresh.
J. M. Keating, in his classic "Histor of the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878,"
with conscientious truthfulness portrays th wretchedly unsanitary condition of th wealthy and rapidly growing city of Mem-
phis then and previously. Many smal towns in Tennessee are steadily makin progress to a like miserably filthy state, i due time to reap like harvest—not from yel-
low fever, it is to be hoped—but from othe scourges which annually destroy many mor lives than does the Cuban fiend. Read,
meditate and inwardly digest the subjoine graphic picture In 1879, warned by costly experience,
Memphis commenced a sanitary refor which has given her a wide fame, an which, if persisted in, will in due tim place her not least among the four gran cities laved by the Father of Waters:
The sanitary condition of Memphis was dis-
graceful in the extreme. Miles of Nicholson pave-
ment were decaying and sending forth a poiso that none in the city limits could avoid, and th soil was reoking with the offal and excreta of te thousand families. There was no organized scav-
enger system, no means by which the ashes an garbage could, as it should, be daily carted away The accumulations of forty years were decayin upon the surface; a bayou dividing the city, an which was the receptacle of the contents of privie and water-closets, was sluggish and without cur-
rent, owing to the want of water and the fact tha there had been scarcely any rain for several weeks Dead animals were decaying in many parts of it,
aud the pools which had formed at the abutment of the several bridges wore stagnant and covere with a scum of putridity, emitting a deadl effluvia. The cellars of the houses in the leadin thoroughfares were also alembics, in which wer manufactured noxious gases, which stole out an made the night air an almost killing poison. Th streets were filthy, and every affliction that coul aggravate a disease so cruel, seemed to have bee purposely prepared for it by the criminal neglec of the city government, who turned a deaf year t the persistent appeals of the press. But the were not wholly to blame; the charter unde which they acted was so worded as to provide bu little funds for sanitary relief, and no relief in cas of the dreadful emergency of an epidemic, not-
withstanding 1867 and 1873. Every interest wa carefully guarded and provided for save that o the health and lives of the people. They mus either take care of themselves—that is. be pre-
pared to abandon their homes when yellow feve or cholera made its appearance—or be ready t meet death. Ignorant of the laws of life, it framers denied to themselves and their fellow-
citizens the advantages of a growing intelligenc in regard to sanitary affairs Disinfecting Establishments in Germany In the last year's meeting of the German PnWic
Health Association, the following resolutions wit reference to disinfecting establishments wer passed:
Each large city should have one or more publi disinfecting stations. For the general use of th public in small towns, transportable disinfectin apparatuses are preferable The use of public disinfecting establishment should bo available to the poor without pay whe their need is certified by the attending physician For purposes of disinfecting, "streaming steam"
(stromede Dampfe) is preferable Tbe choice of the apparatus, and the technica arrangemeut of it, will depend upon the local con-
ditions In connection with tbe disinfecting establish-
ment, it would be advantageous to have a bathin establishment.—Sanitary Inspector, Maine.

The Yellow Fever Outlook for Next
Summer The unusually mild winter noted in all section of the country, taken in connection with the fac that yellow fever still lingers in the tropics, is suf-
ficent to cause a marked feeling of uneasines among the sanitary authorities of the South and
Southwest. Similar meteorological condition were manifest prior to the outbreak of 1878, an there is reason to think that history may repeat it-
self. Yellow fever, even although of an importe type, with the death of a Lieutenant on board o the Yantic in New York harbor on the 14th of Jan-
uary, is enough to cause comment, if not alarm Should the present balmy weather continue int spring, the month of June will most probably ex-
hibit a yellow fever tendency in the Gulf States,
especially in Florida Within the last ten years the railroads and steam-
boats have opened up large additional tracts o territory in the New South; numerous towns hav sprungup, filled with unacclimated Northern me-
chanics, who are not suitable subjects for exposur to the low forms of paludal fevers which annuall prevail in many districts south of Kentucky and
Tennessee. Kapid transit means the swift, sprea of infectious and contagious diseases. It then be-
hooves the various railroad and steamboat interest of the Southwest to settle on some fixed sanitar policy; there are millions of dollars of interests a stake, and it is penny wise and pound foolish t subject such interests to a shotgun-quarantin policy; yet this is what may naturally be expecte every time an outbreak of yellow fever occurs i all States lying below the Appalachian Ridge Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and rail-
road corporations, including sleeping car interests,
should have learned by experience, dearly bought,
that they will not be trusted by those peopl through whose territory they carry infected pas-
sengers so long as the inhabitants know that suc work is not done under medical supervision If the interests of the corporation are to be pro-
tected with those of the individual, co-operatio between railroad and steamboat companies an local sanitary boards will be necessary. Th earlier this is done the presens year the better One case of yellow fever in New Orleans or Jack-
sonville, in June, means an epidemic at Memphis,
Chattanooga and Birmingham in August It is folly to suppose that yellow fever will no spread north of the Ohio River. New York, Phil-
adelphia, and Bostou have been scourged in time past; Louisville, Cincinnati, anil Gallipolis hav had indigenous cases within the last ten years. I is only the fine sanitary work done hy the New
York City Health Department annually that Weep fever out of that port; their work of isolation i more of a protection than the boasted quarantin work of their State authorities After New York. Chicago does the best sanitar work in the country, ami Chicago watches yello fever in Florida, although it is far enough north t be almost beyond the range of epidemic probabili-
ties. As the Eastern States owe a debt of grati-
tude to New York City's Health Department, so d the Northwestern Stales owe the Chicago healt authorities a bounty of praises, for were it not fo their emigrant inspection, Iowa. Wisconsin, Min-
nesota, and other States would suffer from small-
pox. There are able sanitarians in New Orleans,
Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta and Savannah—me who have had executive experience in the manage-
ment of past epidemics The country at large would save millions of dol-
lars annually wore it not subjected to the senseles oxcitements inducod by yellow fever outbreaks If we lived under a more paternal form of govern-
ment, with a centralized power, much could be ac-
complished in the prevention of epidemics; bu the glorious old doctrine of State rights, more de-
fiant than ever, prevails to an alarming extent,
North and South. To meet the requirements o the case, the State Boards of Health must joi forces and act in harmony, for the State Health
Officer of Tennessee must not think differentl from the State Health Officer of Louisiana i matters pertaining to the sanitary inter-state reg-
ulation of the passenger and freight traffic of for-
eign corporations As we before remarked, "It is a warm winter."
With Jacksonville still in sight and to the memor of many dear, yellow fever on the Yantic in New
York harbor, with a death in the middle of Janu-
ary, the outlook for yellow fever next summer i good; alarm is needless, but the warning is give to those most concerned for their best interests.—

elm trees in full bloom, and plum trees budding Sergt. J. B. Marbury, U. S. Observer at Nash-
ville, furnishes the following notes for the month:
"The general conditions of the atmosphere fo the month were, in some respects, different fro the average, viz.: The mean temperature, 36°,
was about nine degrees below the normal for th past 16 years, while the barometric pressure wa slightly in excess of the average; the amount o precipitation was very low."
The Observer at Andersonville reports the fol-
lowing: ''The rain on the night of the 18th wa the severest ever known hereabouts. The aggre-
gate rainfall for the night was not very unusual,
but between 12 and 1 o'clock it came down in  perfect sluice. The high branches washed ou fences never before moved by water. Even th woods in many places were swept bare of leave over the whole surface. The earth appeared t have been literally covered with running water Mnch damage was done in washing the land an washing away the fencing. Lightning struck an ignited and entirely destroyed a hay stack nea this place. The thunder during the nights of the
17th and 18th was particularly heavy The Observer at Parksville makes the followin note: "A beautiful month. We had had, we weather from the 13th to the 19th. The water were high on the 16th. Farmers have had severa good, dry days in which to plow."
The Observer at Riddleton says: "Februar was a most disagreeable month—very few day that were clear all day."
The Observer at Florence Station says: "Th soil was very cold throughout the month—no until the 26th was it warm enough to bring u oats."
The Observer at Lawrenccburg makes the fol-
lowing notes: "The rainy season of the 14th-
17th closed with a remarkable display of celestia pyrotechnics. At 8 p. m. the whole sky was over-
cast with an apparently homogeneous mass o cloud. Peals of thunder from the southern quarte indicated the existence in that region of a thunde cloud, which was concealed by the underlyin mass, while the flashes of lightning rendered th sky one almost continuous blaze of light."
Sergt. Pindell, U. S. Observer at Chattanooga,
reports the rainfall at stations outside the State a follows: Murphy, N. C, 5.71 inches; Charleston,
N. C, 3.80 iuches, and snowfall 2.80 inches;
Asheville, N. C, 1.42 inch The following is the January report for Ander-
sonville Station, which was received too late fo insertion: Mean temperature, 38° 8; mean o maximum temperature, 45^.5; mean of minimu temperature, 33°.0; highest temperature, 60°, o the 17th; lowest temperature, 20°, on the 22d;
range, 40°; mean daily range, 13°.6; total rain-
fall, 2.19 inches; mean daily rainfall, 0.071 inch;
greatest rainfall in 24 consecutive hours, 1.10 inch,
on the 27th; snowfall, trace on the 9th and 28th;
clear days, 11; fair days 6; cloudy days, 14 ; day on which 0.01 rain fell, 3; solar halos, 1st, 11th;
fogs, 7th, 17; prevailing wind, southwest The thunderstorm of the night of the 16th at
Nashville was the occasion of one of the most re-
markably displays of electricity ever witnessed a this place. From 9 p. m. to midnight a ver heavy cloud passed to the north of the city, wit vivid lightning and heavy thunder. At midnigh another cloud passed from the southwest to th southeast with incessant lightning, diffuse an zigzag, and a continuous roll of thunder. Thi storm center passed about fifty miles south ol
Nashville, aud was accompanied with one of th heaviest rains ever known in the section ove which it passed. One of the bridges on the
Louisville and Nashville railroad in Maury count was washed away, causing much delay and incon-
venience in the regular running of trains. A
great deal of damage was done to fencing by th sudden rise of the streams. This storm was fol-
lowed by a cold wave With this report appears the first report of Dr.
A. Slack, the Observer in charge of the now statio at Cog Hill, McMinn county. This is an im-
portant point in the Eastern division, and promise to show good results in the collection of data In the transfer of Sergt. L. N. Jesnnofsky, fo many years U. S. Observer in charge of the Nash-
ville station, the service in the State loses a valua-
ble and faithful officer. Much of the success o the service in Tennessee during the past six year is due to the prompt and cheerful co-operation of
Sergt. Jesunofsky, and it is safe to say that th best wishes of his many friends in Tennessee g with him to his new field of usefulness in New
York City. Sergt. Jesunofsky is succeeded by
Sergt. J. B. Marbury, who has already given evi-
dence of being worthy to occupy the place left b his predecessor It is to be regretted that several of the voluntar observers have failed to send in their February re-
ports in time for insertion.

Office State Board of Health,
NabhVILLB, April 2, 1889.
J>r. J. D. Plunket, President State Board 0/ Health:
Sir—At the quarterly meeting of this Board,
held January 8th and 9th, attention was called t the great necessity of radical improvements in the
State House—commonly called the Capitol, i imitation of imperial Rome, though the good old
English term is far preferable, as being more dem-
ocratic and raoro significant of the real uses t which said building is applied. For a truth, it i the dwelling house of the State of Tennessee,
wherein the legislative, executive and suprem judiciary all meet and work for the good of th grand old Commonwealth After full deliberation the Board unanimousl adopted the following resolution:
Sesolred, That the attention of the General
Assembly be called to the prest-ing necessity o improving the sanitary condition of the Capitol b systematic ventilation, heating and drainage o the building upon the most improved plans, a may be indicated after a careful survey shall hav been made by experts The Secretary was directed to transmit th same to the Speaker of the Senate and the Speake of the House, with an appropriate letter Accordingly, on January 14th, the communica-
tion subjoined was sent in as directed:
Office State Board ok Health,
Nashville, Tenn., January 14, 1889 Hon. B. J. Lea, Speaker of the Senate:
Sir—I am directed by the State Board of Hoalt to send you a copy of a resolution unanimousl adopted by said Board, at its meeting on January
9th, to-wit:
"Revolted, That the attention of the General
Assembly be called to the pressing necessity o improving the sanitary condition of the Capitol b systematic ventilation, heating and drainage o the building upon the most improved plans, a may be indicated after a careful survey shall hav been made by experts."
Allow mo to add that, inasmuch as the Asylu for the Insane near Enoxvillo was furnished a yea or so ago with most complete apparatus for heat-
ing and ventilation, and the one now nearly com-
pleted at Bolivar is a model in these respects,
there can be no difficulty m securing plans an estimates from experts whose work is already wel known and tested in Tennessee Very respectfully,
J. Berrien Lindsley,
•Secretory The Senate and House took such action as le to a thorough examination of the building, an resulted in an elaborate and comprehensive re-

port (which will be found elsewhere in this num-
ber) by the Executive Committee as representin the Board, which was transmitted to tho Speaker of each House The fact that the present General Assembly ha been called upon to make large appropriations fo buildings and objects that cannot brook delay,
and also tho fact that tho State has been com-
pelled to borrow money to meet interest due on it funded debt, sufficiently account for delay i carrying out the recommendations of this Boar at the present time There can lie no doubt that the Forty-Seventh
General Assembly will see to it that a State llous which, with its appurtenances, could not be re"
placed for one and a half million of dollars, an which is universally conceded to be one of th handsomest in the grand Union of forty-two
States, shall not go to ruin and remain unfit fo lack of a few thousand dollars The following additions have been made to the

Secretary Dr. Plunket, delegate to the Quarantine
Conference recently held at Montgomery,
presented a very full report of that conven-
tion, which was listened to with much inter-
est by the members, and it brought up fo consideration the subject of quarantine i general and inland quarantine in particular,
and led to a thorough review of the method adopted heretofore in the South, especiall those of last summer On motion of Judge Hadden the repor was received and ordered printed, wit thanks to the reporter. (See page 157 o this Bulletin.)
Dr. Plunket presented a report upon hi investigation on March 8th, in Decatur,
Ala., of the rumored "suspicious case" o yellow fever, with death, of Roberta John-
ston at that point in February last. A this report has already been widely printe in the newspapers it was received an ordered filed The Board adjourned until 3 o'clock, a which hour it reassembled Dr. Plunket, chairman of Committee on
Legislation, reported that he had succeede in getting the vital statistics bill through the
Senate. The members of the Board al hoped that the House would make it a law The water supply of several cities wa discussed, and examinations will be mad at an early date of the artesian wells of
Memphis, which have attracted great atten-
tion throughout the United States From statements made by the member of the Board it was evident that interest i sanitary work is very much on the increas in Tennessee, and also that the efforts o the Board are very much appreciated After examining and approving accounts,
the Board adjourned to meet on Tuesday,
July 2, 1889 Report to the Legislature on the Needs o the Capitol Building, by State
Board of Health Office State Board of Health,
Nashville, Tenn., March 15, 1889 To the Forty-Sixth General Assembly of the Stat of Tennessee:
Sirs—In compliance with the following HouBe
Joint Resolution No. 68, concurred in by tho Sen-
ate on March 12th:
"licit resolved by the General Assembly of the
State of Tennessee, That the State Board of Healt he requested to investigate the sanitary conditio of the Capitol and report to the General Assembl at its earliest convenience the most approved pla for tho systematic ventilation, heating and drain-
age of tho building, with estimates of cost of th same, and for this purpose they may, if they dee it necessary, have a careful survey made by com-
petent experts, the cost of which shall be provide for in the general appropriation bill Resolved further, That a copy of this resolutio be furnished the President or Secretary of the
State Board of Health.
"Adopted February 19, 1889."
The State Board of Health would report tha there are three principal sanitary defects in the
Capitol building, any one of which may seriously

damage the health of persons occupying sai bmlding, even for a short time The water-closets are so situated and so con-
structed as to draw up foul sewer gases from th largo extent of drain pipes between the buildin and Lick branch. These foul emanations fro sewers are universally regarded as most insidiou and dangerous poisons At times the atmosphere of the whole lowe corridors are permeated with such deleteriou gases The present mode of heating the Capitol is  mere makeshift, long since banished from all pub-
lic buildings. With stoves and fire-places it i impossible to heat the offices, corridors and legis-
lative halls with any degree of uniformity As to ventilation, during that portion of th year in which the building is most used, there i simply none—consequently legislators, jurists an other officials while engaged in the performance o duty are breathing an unwholesome atmosphere,
which tends to incapacitate them fur calm, health-
ful thought During the past thirty years, both in Europe an the United States, many and costly experiment have been made in order to relieve public build-
ings, especially city balls, capitols and charitabl institutions, from the great ills growing out of de-
fective drainage, heating and ventilation. Thes have finally ended in one result, to-wit, the estab-
lishment of a plant by which these buildings ar artificially ventilated, heated by hot air, steam o hot water, and foul gases effectually expelled While the language of the resolution unde which this report is made does not specificall embrace the idea of decay which is to be see going on in so many parts of tho building, yet t omit a reference to it in this connection would, i the opinion of the State Board of Health, be bu little less than culpable The extent of this decay we feel sure is mor serious and widespread than is generally known,
aud in some portions of the structure has by neg-
lect become so urgent as now not to admit o longer delay in having the necessary attentio given it That you may have full aud reliable data i this regard, will say that we have had made  careful inspection of the entire structure by on eminently qualified for such work, and submit fo your earnest consideration the following extract taken from his report upon tho subject:
"In the first place as regards tho approaches All the stone ontsido shows more or less evi-
dence of decay, many of the steps and curbin having been badly broken and rapidly going t pifces It is not of very much importance in the isolate steps, but those which are in flights will shortly b in ruins if something is not done to protectthem The terrace around the outside <>1 the building-
contains a number ot cisterns. The stone of whic it is built is all laminated, and we found by sound-
ing them with a cane that fully ten per cent, o them wore split through and through by the actio of tho frost The action of the water from the cisterns on th inside with the action of the weather will ver soon make all the terrace a wreck. Prompt actio could save this terrace, but if it is delayed even  short time longer it will require to lie renewe from the beginning. Wo would recommend tha a covering be placed over it which would exclud the water from the t«>p If this was done in dry weather it is more tha likely that a large portion of the frost actio would cease Immediately over the grand stairway, from th office floor up, there is an arch spanning its ful width We were unable to reach this arch to determin whether it was of brick or stone. It is badl broken at both ends, and if of heavy material, a we presume it is, and not sustained by an iro beam, is in imminent danger of falling.
I should say that there could be no justificatio for not taking immediate steps to ascertain its ma-
terial, aud if of brick or stone it idionld bo re-
moved at once The entrance to the water-closets, with th present absence of any systematic exhaust of fou air from the building, shows very large evidence o tho increased action of ammoniacal salts, due t the presence of the foul air on the walls of th passages loading to it, many of them being cov-
ered with a fine dust of disintegrated stone. Thi action is going on throughout the building, but i more particularly marked there because it is mor rapid there than elsewhere The condensation of water on the bare ston walls of the interior is doing an immense amoun of mischief In many places the writer noticed puddles o water which form there from the dripping of con-
densed water from the walls This water, washing down as it does, the wslls>
already foul by exposure to tho bad air of th building, and having been condensed from ai which is probably already exhausted, contains  large proportion of deleterious element to a ston of this character Unless some means is taken to get rid of thi actiou, there is no saying how soon the iuterior o the building will bo in as bad condition as the ex-
terior The writer also noticed some curious actiou o settlement probably in the piers of the dome There are a number of cracked stones in thes piers. Tho northeast and northwest piers contai respectively thirteen and sixteen cracked stones,
while the southwest and southeast contain respec-
tively four and two. These cracks generally see to follow about the lines that would occur wher stono has not been well bedded and is very heavil loaded There is, however, a locality in which evidenc of settlement is unquestionable, the anionnt whic tho stone work has moved being perceptible. That,
is near tho northwest pier, along tho wall joinin it to the northwest wait.

I am unable to account for this settlement,
vhich seems to be only vuible here and at the ex-
treme north end of the building, unless it is tha mime of the exposed limestone underneath, upo which the building is founded, have the under-
lined strata of marl washed out of them, and th settlement is taking place on this account.
1 do not advance this as a filed opinion.
A further evidence of this settlement is given i the fact that there are two broken steps in th grand stairway where it turns from the first fligh to go to the second flight There are also two broken flag stones. I do no think either one can fall at present, althoug further cracking might possibly cause their fall,
and the fall of thU or any other portion migh valise the death of one or more of the valuabl citizens of Tennessee On examination of the outside of the buildin we find on the north end that every lintel an pilaster is broken The liutels are uniforml made of three pieces of stone, two set on edge t form tho in.-ide and outside faces, and the thir filling the space between them. Many of thes are broken in several places. We believe tha this is duo to lnut action, brought about in th following way: The floors of the porticos of th building are entirely uncovered. Water seepin through them will necessarily saturate the wall upon which they rest, and will filter down to th depths of the pilasters. Having been wetted i this way tlnir fracture by frost is a very simpl matter There is further evidence of trouble also at thi point apart from the fracture above mentioned That, is to say, that there are two causes of frac-
ture existing at this point—ono from frost on ac-
count of the infiltration of water through th stones, which falls upon the main portico, an the other due to some settlement which we can-
not account for Our opinion as to frost action is confirmed b the fact that on the south entrance there are n broken lintels, while on the east and west ther are only a very few—probably three would cove the number in the two porticoes This could be materially protected by coverin the porticoes with some impervious covering so a to stop tho infiltration of water there.
l''or example, they might be covered with shee copper iu such a way as to permit of their bein freidy walked on, and yet form a perfectly imper-
vious covering We forgot to note ono fact in connection wit this, which is, that the plastering on the east en of the arch under tho main portico, which is  brick arch covered with plaster, has begun to fal away and show evidence of the character of deca which takes place in a wet wall The entire outside of the building is built o stone of a very inferior quality, and tho most vig-
orous action is necessary to prevent the deca which is now so disfiguring and apparent fro going so far as to render what is probably th most beautiful example of classic architecture i the United States a ruin It is difficult to say how long it would bo befor this building would become a ruin, but it is certai that tho time, unless something is done, is limited,
and that great difficulty will be experienced i meeting inquiries as to why proper steps were no taken for its protection As regards remedies, it would he possible t plaster the entire stone interior of the buildin without disfiguring in such a way as to stop th condensation of water, except on the palistor which have capitols It would be necessary in this case to do som additional work before plastering Of course the pla»tering should he applied wit an air chamber between it and the stone We consider that it is necessary that the build-
ing should bo veneered with either marble or som other durable stone for its protection. Say veneer-
ing was applied by cutting away the stone an bolting a flush stone to it, so as to give an entirel new surface out and out. It will doubtless see that this is a heroic measure, but we know of n instance in which a stone radically inferior ha been saved by means of the preservatives whic are ordinarily applied We therefore consider that tho shortost an most effective way to handle it would be to pro-
tect the stone entirely by exposing an entirel new surface to the atmosphere, composed of ston which is known to stand its effect*."

Dear Sir—In accordance with our intervie had tnis morning I submit the following in refer-
ence to heating and ventilating the Capitol build-
ing, it being understood that the figures given ar approximate, and will be possibly subject to con-
siderable modification, and I have taken care t assume my data sufficiently large to insure tha the cost of execution will come under, rather tha over the amount hereinafter stated. The buildin embraces a cubic content of one million an ninety-one thousand cubic feet, in which the ai must be renewed entirely every hour and fresh ai furnished at a suitable temperature in order t insure perfect ventilation To insure this result there would be required  duct capable of carrying fifty-five cubic feet of ai per lineal foot of its section at the rate of six fee per second, or two and a half miles per hour This rate of flow will bo proserved throughou tho system, and will insure that no objections du to draughts, either of cold or warm air, can arise Tho above stated amount of warm air being intro-
duced into the building, a similar amount mus ho evacuated from it One million cubic feet of air will weigh, approx-
imately, at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, 72.000 pounds,
and this must be lifted through an average heigh of 70 feet, amounting to 5,340,000 foot pounds o work to be accomplished per hour, without con-
sidering loss from friction or curvature.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Liberal allowance for these will indicate that a
12-horse engine could accomplish the work of in-
spiration. A similar engine must be furnished t perforin the work of expiration. A 25 - hors power engine could therefore, under all circum-
stances, perform the necessary service To warm 1,000,000 cubic leet of air there wil be required a steam main of 109 inches section,
and there would be about 11,000 feet of radiatin surface necessary There would be consumed one pound of coal fo every 6,000 feet of air warmed to a difference of
70 degrees between the inside and outside tempera-
tures, or a maximum of 2.000 pouuds of coal pe day.
I have thought it advisable, in view of tho fac that if the apparatus were placed within the build-
ing, a smoke-stack must be erected somewher within it, to make an estimate of cost of placin the entire plant on a separate lot, reaching it b means of underground ducts for both inspiratio and expiration, placing there the boilers, engine and fans. It would be necessary, under this sys-
tem, to distribute in the basement of the buildin the warmed air through a svsteni of pipes whic would lead to the various rising ducts, and by th introduction of false partitions in the recesses o the walls in the first story, to form ducts for th delivery of fresh air, and the abstraction of fou air to the second story. Were it decided that th stack mentioned would not sufficiently mar th appearance of the building to prevent, and i therefore were placed inside, a very considerabl reduction could be made. The entire cost of th apparatus first described would possibly amount to
$32,400, including plumbers' work, which I shal hereafter describe; were it decided lo place th boilers within the building and erect the stack als within it, a difference in cost of something like
$9,000 could be made, making the total cost o heating, plumbing and ventilation $2:5,400 1 be-
lieve it practicable to place the boilers within th building and get rid of the smoke by means of a underground duct, discharging at some point dis-
tant from the building, and so located as to avoi annoyance to the property of persons living nea by. I have not, however, at present the data fo such a step so clearly in my mind as to justify m in submitting an estimate of cost, although I a of opinion that $1,500 added to the $23,400 abov mentioned would probably cover it. In consider-
ing this idea it must be borne in mind that the ap-
pearance of a flue discharging smoke out of th ground without visible cause is to be taken int careful consideration before a project involving it use would be adopted.
I have not included in the estimate above give the purchase of the ground necessary upon whic to locate the plant above described In regard to the plumbers' work, there should b a lavatory provided on both the first and secon floors for both ladies and gentlemen. My estimat has included performing this work in a satisfactor and suitable manner to suit the style of the build-
ing in which it is to be placed. I feel safe in say-
ing that the problem in question can be brought t a successful solution within the sum stated above,
and possibly very far within it, although, in orde to insure satisfactory results, I would recommen that a properly constituted committee be author-
ized to expend, if necessary, up to tho full amount There is no ventilating apparatus in use in thi country with which the writer is familiar that ca be expected to give better results than the on estimated for in this paper, and I feel safe in say-
ing that the extremes in difference of temperatur will not be more at any point, except immediatel at the entrance, than five degrees With the exhaust system above mentioned i use tho avoidance of the discharge of foul air fro the city sewers becomes a matter of the greates simplicity, and, without going into details, I wil say that the sewer gas can be entirely eliminate from the building. I will also remark that no
"gravity" or "natural" system can be relie upon to work satisfactorily in unpropitiou weather, and that nothing will secure positive re-
sults except a power which can be relied on i all weathers, as steam can be, for which I hav herein estimated.
I have the honor to be, with great respect Tours, etc.,

Board of Health:
Sirs—In compliance with your commis-
sion appointing me your delegate to the
Quarantine Conference, held in Montgom-
ery, Ala., upon the 5th to 8th of March, I
respectfully report that I left Nashville upon
Monday, the 4th ult., at 7.30 A. M., and ar-
rived in Montgomery the evening of sam day, about 7 p. m The Conference convened the followin morning at 10 o'clock in the House of Rep-
resentatives at the Capitol. There wer eleven States represented, giving a tota delegation of sixty-five, divided as follows:
Alabama, 13, among whom I noted th railroad interests were represented by Col.
J. C. Clark, General Manager of the Mobile
& Ohio Railroad; Theodore Welch, Gen-
eral Transportation Agent of the Louisville
& Nashville Railroad, and B. C. Epperson,
Superintendent of the Mobile & Montgom-
ery Railroad; and among the medical repre-
sentatives who held commissions from the
Governor of Alabama were Dr. John B Hamilton, Surgeon General of the United
States Marine Hospital Service, and Dr. W.

M. Sternberg, Surgeon U. S. A.; Victor C Vaughan, member State Board of Healt of Michigan; George Homan, Secretary
State Board of Health of Missouri; W. C Van Bibber, of Maryland, and D. M. Bur-
gess, of Havana, Cuba. The delegate from Tennessee were Hon. David Park
Hadden, Drs. G. B. Thornton and J. E Black, from Memphis, and myself, and i the permanent organization of the Confer-
ence, Tennessee was complimented by se-
lecting Hon. D. P. Hadden for one of its
Vice Presidents—there being one from each
State represented After a brief, earnest and sincere greetin from his Excellency Gov. Thomas Seay, the
President, Dr. C. P. Wilkinson, of Louisiana,
declared the meeting ready for business,
and appointed two committees of twelv each, one "On Papers and Resolutions,"
upon which Tennessee was represented by
Dr. G. B. Thornton, and one "On Busi-
ness," upon which your reporter served The first paper read was upon "Maritime
Quarantine Services of the Southern Sea-
ports," by Dr. C. P. Wilkinson, the now
President of the Louisiana State Board of
Health, and successor of the distinguished
Holt. Dr. Wilkinson is about 35 years old,
has a cool, clear head, firm and decidedl practical, and seems to realize fully the re-
sponsibilities of his office and its relation t the millions of people inhabiting the Missis-
sippi Valley. This much I have thought i necessary to say for your information abou the man who now stands sanitary guard a the mouth of the Mississippi River. Th paper read by him was full of detail of th methods pursued at the quarantine statio below New Orleans, which are those know as the "Holt system," except in place o the wooden cylinders heretofore used fo heating purposes iron ones are to be substi-
tuted. He emphasized the importance an desirability of having a similarly equippe station at all the large ports in the United
States upon the Gulf, and also those of
Central and South America During the discussion of the paper whic followed it was suggested by Dr. George M Sternberg, Surgeon U. S. A., that where i becomes necessary in the interior of th country to apply the principles of the
Louisiana system, a locomotive could con-
veniently be used to supply the steam Surgeon General Hamilton, M. H. S.,
stated that he was of the opinion that the
Government ought to construct cars wit steel chambers with super-heated steam gen-
erators, so that they could be moved fro place to place, as the exigencies of the hou demanded. Such plans had already bee filed at Government headquarters, and h hoped to have the cars ready in case the should be needed during the approachin summer The following resolution was unanimousl adopted:
Resolved, That this conference endorse the
Holt quarantine and disinfection system, a at present operated in New Orleans, as th best one known for the prevention of th introduction of yellow fever into the port of the United States, and recommend it uniform adoption The Conference was a very industriou assembly, and even if it had had an oppor-
tunity extended it by the citizens of Mont-
gomery of meeting socially her people, i could not have done so without suspendin a rule, which was early adopted, of holding,
each day, a morning, afternoon and nigh session An interesting paper was read by Col. J.
C. Clark on "Railroad Quarantine." Thi was a practical paper, from a very practica man, and one who, as manager of railroads,
has had large experience during the pas fifteen years with inland quarantines.

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN He urged the importance of all inlan quarantines being under the sole control of
State Boards of Health, and thought th maritime quarantine should be managed b the general Government The following sixteen propositions pro-
posed by the "Committee on Business" fo discussion were taken up separately an considered seriatim:
Question I. What form of notificatio shall be adopted in case of occurrence o yellow fever? To whom shall the first noti-
fication be sent?
Dr. G. B. Thornton offered the following:
Resolved, Tliat this Conference urges upo all health authorities of States represente in it the importance of strict complianc with the agreement of interstate notificatio adopted by the National Conference of
State Boards of Health and the Sanitary
Council of the Mississippi Valley, in regar to all communicable diseases, and especiall in regard to yellow fever After being amended so that notificatio shall also be sent to the Surgeon General o the Marine Hospital Service, it was adopted Ques. 2. Under what circumstance should an epidemic be declared to exist?
After discussion by several this was, upo motion, tabled Qucs. j. Should we advise depopulatio in the event of the appearance of yello fever in any place, and if so, how soon?
The following was adopted as the sens of the Conference:
In the beginning of an outbreak of yello fever there is no need of depopulation a all, except of infected houses, or infecte districts; but if people who are able t afford the expense desire to leave they shoul do so quietly and deliberately, and no ob-
stacles should be placed in their way; an those who leave healthy districts of the cit or town should go wherever they please,
without let or hindrance Persons living in infected houses, or i infected districts, should be encouraged t leave, but should be allowed to leave onl under such restrictions as will afford reason-
able guarantees of safety to the communi-
ties in which they find asylum; and the should be sent only to such communities a are willing to receive them In the depopulation of infected houses o of special infected districts, the inhabitant should be removed into camps of probation,
or into vacant houses in the adjacent coun-
try. After ten days' detention, if they re-
main well, and under proper regulations,
such as disinfection of baggage, they shoul be considered free from danger, and allowe to go freely into any community willing t receive them Quts. 4. Is it practicable to cause depop-
ulation of large cities?
Tabled Ques. 5. Are probation camps desirable?
By'whom should they be managed and sup-
ported?
Tabled Ques. 6. On the occurrence of a case o yellow fever, what immediate measures o isolation are desirable?
Substitute adopted Ques. 7. What means of disinfectio should be adopted for chambers and dwell-
ings where cases of yellow fever have oc-
curred?
During the discussion of this proposition
Hon. D. P. Hadden arose in his seat an said: "Directly in connection with the sub-
ject under consideration he desired, in ac-
cordance with instructions given him a chairman of a committee appointed by the
Sanitary Council of the Mississippi Valley,
to present a resolution, which had bee unanimously adopted by that body, and as the concurrence of the Conference regardin it, which motion he would now make."
The resolution was as follows:
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Sani-
tary Council of the Mississippi Valley that
Decatur, Ala., under existing circumstances,
should, without delay, be thoroughly disin-
fected and otheiwise placed in the best sani-
tary condition, and that the proper authori-
ties, either State or local, are respectfully

■urged to see that the same is done imme-
diately Dr. Jerome Cochrane, State Health office of Alabama, sprang at once to his feet, an said "that it would be useless adopting thi resolution, for he would assure the confer-
ence that no such thing would be done. H knew that not a single germ of yellow feve still existed in Decatur; he knew it. The
State of Alabama had the money to do th work asked for, and he had control of it,
but he would cut off his right hand befor he would do this work."
Mayor Austin, of Decatur, followed in a earnest, strong statement of the grievance of that city in regard to the inattention o the Alabama State Health officer to the pe-
tition of his people for a thorough disinfec-
tion of D'-catur. Not one of the man speakers who followed in the discussion o this resolution expressed the slightest doub of its importance or necessity, but the ten-
dency was decidedly to drift away from th subject matter of the resolution, and instead,
substitute a personal one. With this view,
the Conference voted to lay the resolutio upon the table, when, if a vote could hav been had direct upon the original proposi-
tion, it would jnquestionably have bee adopted by a large majority Ques. 8. What system of disinfectio should be adopted for the disinfection o personal baggage of persons fleeing from a infected place?
A motion was adopted that moist heat i the best known disinfectant Ques. p. Health certificates Ques. 10. When refugees may return Ques. ii. Hibernation; indefinitely post-
poned Ques. 12. Shotgun quarantines are barbar-
ous and discreditable to our civilization All quarantines should be under the con-
trol of experts Ques. ij. During the prevalence of yel-
low fever epidemics, passengers and freight should be brought from infected localitie only under such regulations and restriction as may be established by the State healt authorilies along the lines of the roads con-
cerned Ques. 14. The passage of railroad train should he allowed, without obstruction, eve when carrying sick refugees from infecte places to healthy localities willing to receiv them Ques. 15. Quarantine inspectors on rail-
road trains should be under the control o the health authorities of the several States,
rather than under the control of the healt authorities of the communities scattere along the line of the road. In this wa quarantine regulations may be enforce with the smallest amount of friction an inconvenience to the traveling public,
and with the maximum of efficiency an economy. At the same time the wishes o the local authorities should be treated wit all due consideration Ques. 16. Local quarantines, that is t say, the separate quarantine of towns an counties, should, as far as circumstance will warrant, be superseded by State quar-
antines, and this on the ground alike o economy, efficiency and convenience The "Committee on Papers," in their re-
port upon Col. J. C. Clark's paper, sub-
mitted a series of propositions suggested b the paper, which were found similar in thei significance and practically were embrace in those suggested by the "Committee on
Business," as they appear above. Much in-
teresting and profitable discussion was ha upon these several propositions, and tha the views of the Conference might be ac-
curately reported a committee of eleve was appointed to take charge of the differ-
ent propositions considered; and draft  code of rules and regulations in accordanc with the views expressed by the Conference,
to be recommended to the different healt organizations in the several States repre-
sented in the Conference for adoption That there might also be no conflict o opinion as held by the Conference upon th points at issue and the Sanitary Council o the Mississippi Valley, time was given thi committee in which to confer with th executive committee of the Council, and,
as far as possible, agree upon a set of uni-
form rules and regulations to be observed i the conduct of all inland quarantines here-

after. These will appear in the publishe proceedings of the Conference, which wil soon be issued, copies of which will be for-
warded to this Board Dr. W. C. Van Bibber, of Baltimore,
read an interesting paper upon "The Quar-
antine of the Future." He said it woul resemble much the modern fire departmen of a great city, a thoroughly organized de-
partment, with experienced chiefs, improve apparatus and thorough drill. The fir alarm now scarcely causes a ripple of ex-
citement. So it would be in time of epi-
demic, for the people would then know an feel that with such a health service, what-
ever can be done will be done, as the whol business would be in the hands of thos most competent to manage it Dr. D. M. Burgess, a resident of Havana,
Cuba, for the past twenty-five years, an who is now attached to the United States
Consulate at that place as medical inspector,
read a very interesting paper upon "The
Sanitary Inspection Service at Havana,
Island of Cuba." He dwelt with muc emphasis upon the careless manner in whic health certificates are issued by the Cuba authorities to ships and sailors coming t the United States ports. He said the great-
est danger of the introduction of yello fever into this country from Cuba was b means of smuggling schooners carrying o their illegal traffic between that island and
Florida The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treas-
ury of the United States is hereby requeste to increase the patrol service of the coast of
Florida to such an extent as may be neces-
sary to prevent smuggling Two very able and instructive lecture were delivered before the conference, on upon " Hunting Yellow Fever Germs," by
Dr. G. M. Sternberg, Surgeon U. S. A.,
and the leading bacteriologist of this country,
and the other upon "Ptomaines, or the
Poisons Generated by Fever Germs," by
Dr. V. C. Vaughan, member of the State
Board of Health of Michigan, and Pro-
fessor of Chemistry in the University at Ann
Arbor During the noon recess upon the secon day the attention of the members of the
Conference was called to the merits of  cremation furnace which is now in use i quite a number of places in this country,
and as a number of towns in Tennesse would find it to their advantage to look into-
this matter, I will simply add a word upo this one, a model of which was exhibited The problem of constructing a furnace mod-
erate in cost, economical in fuel, capable o destroying quickly all varieties of wast matter, with practical freedom from noxiou smoke and gases while in operation, and a the same time afford a product which wil be remunerative for fertilizing uses, is t realize what has been until recently only-
ideal This, it is claimed by "The Engle Sani-
tary and Cremation Company of DesMoines.
and New York," they can do, and the propose to submit estimates for the erec-
tion of furnaces at any place, large o small, and put same into active operation,
with payment conditional upon satisfactory-
performance. Nashville might find, upo investigation, one or two of these furnace much more economical and satisfactory tha the expensive sewers she is now constructin under great difficulty and by piecemeal Clippings from the Montgomery Adver-

or will have as soon as the Governor can appoin it. The special session of the Legislature, calle to form a board, has succeeded in its mission, an the Governor lias signed the act This act calls for the appointment by the Gov-
ernor, within thirty days, of a hoard to consist o three members; this body will meet immediately,

bers, select from the State at largea secretary an au executive or health officer, the latter to be  physician. The board is given ample power t protect the State by means of quarantines o otherwise as it sees fit. The full text is not a hand, but from what we see in the dispatches w think the act is carefully worded and yet libera enough to give the board ample breadth of action It was proposed for a time to emasculate th whole action by exempting Pensacola from th jurisdiction of the board, and granting to tha town special health privileges. Fortunately thi was defeated. A board to be efficient must be su-
preme, and not only supreme, but soldi/ and (dim responsible. There must be no bickerings or con-
flict of authority. There is no objection to count or municipal boards of health for the care of loca hygiene and health matters, but it would be fata to the successful work of the State Hoard if thes local boards could in any way supersede or ham-
per the State organization The last epidemic has discovered many fine me in Florida, and we rather imagine that the Gov-
ernor's trouble will be not in finding suitable men,
but in chosing from the large number so wel fitted for the positions.
"We congratulate Florida that she has a board a last, and we are glad to know that she can onc more move on in her line of development, and ca once more open her doors to visitors without fea or criticism.—Xew Orleans Medical and Surgical
Journal Home Sanitation Not only the skilled sanitarian, health officer,
man of science, or medical man can become  practical sanitarian, but each head of a family an each individual can become a health officer, pro-
viding, in a measure, proper sanitation for his im-
mediate home and surroundings. The physica training and development of physical manhood o the Spartans did not depend more on laws an customs than on home influence and self-educa-
tion. So to-day the healthfulness of the home an the consequent vigor of the family do not depend,
or should not, more on the man of science an technical learning than on the care, education,
habits, and the observance of the plain, simpl rules of health of the individual whose observa-
tions every day cover his abode and realm of ex-
istence. Jfo man is entitled to a home unless h can make that home happy and healthful. He ha no right to be the means of bringing misery t others or to leave to posterity the legacy of ill-
health or constitutional weakness. It is the dut of all to be healthy and so observe the laws o hygiene that be may contribute the full measur of his individual well-being to the public good His indifference or neglect of health laws and th observance of the sanitation of his home is no only a crime against himself but the infliction of  wrong on the public and a burden on posterity In this country, with its plan of society and inter-
course, no family is isolated. Whatever condition may produce disease in one family are often re-
sponsible for sickness in others. Cases are record-
ed where disease has had its origin traced to ver remote causes both as to time and place, and thes causes have been found to be the result of neglec in the proper care of the home. The fact tha such cases are not always found in the homes o the destitute and ignorant is evidence that in fam-
ilies of the well-to-do and cultured there is a wan of the observance of the simplest sanitary precau-
tions, which, we are constrained to believe, result more from neglect and indifference than from igno-
rance of the means to be employed,
A mistaken idea prevails that an epidemic mus prevail before there is need for any sanitary pre-
cautions, when the truth is. such epidemics ar always evidence that these precautious have bee fataliy neglected. Moreover, the greatest mortal-
ity does not result, from epidemics, but from death constantly occurring in the course of such disease as are admitted to be wholly preventable, and re-
suit most frequently from the unsanitary condi-
tions of neglected homes, and, in the absence o inspection and preventive means, extend through-
out communities. Such diseases as diphtheria,
scarlet fever, typhoid, and others of this class, ar constantly carrying off their victims, and, in th aggregate, far surpass the deaths in epidemics These diseases, if they do not result directly fro ill-kept homes, find a lodgment, and their viru-
lence and extent is increased. To such a degre has sanitary knowledge been disseminated, an the facilities for gaining such knowledge are s ample, that it is not a Utopian dream to suppos every individual a sanitarian and every home  sanitarium It is not so much the ignorance of health law as it is the ueglect of their observance that is re-
sponsible for the greater portions of ills that afflic humanity. The lesson to be taught is the prope use of the knowledge imparted. The State board of health within the past few years have mad great and rapid advances. Some of the State are so thoroughly organized that on the first ap-
pearance of infectious diseases notification i given, and means for the prevention of their con-
tagion are instantly employed.—Sanitary Sews Registration of Vital Statistics Advan-
tages of.
1. It forms the basis of all sanitary work. In
England their improved system of registration o births, marriages and deaths was begun in 1837,
and since then it has served as a guide to indicat the places where there has been the greatest nee of taking measures to improve the public health If, in a given town it is found that the death rat from typhoid fever, consumption, diarrhceal dis-
eases of children, or other diseases is higher tha it ought to be. the Lo;al Government Board insti-
tutes an inquiry into the causes of the prevailin high rate of mortality. As the result of these in-
quiries local boards have been led in many of th towns to take measures which have reduced th death rate in a marked degree. Massachusett has had its system of registration of vital statistic for many years and finds its records of the greates value in determining general and local rates o mortality, or whether a given disease is less o more prevalent than formerly.
2. To prevent the concealment of crime. Th indispensable provision of modem registration law which requires a certificate from friends or the at-
tending physician of the cause q/ death and a

iurial permit is an assurance of safety in this di-
rection.
3. To ensure the means of proof of persona identity and of right to property. One Senator i our Legislature 1887 told the writer that it cos him fifty dollars to look up the proof of the dat of a birth. The applicants for pensions in Massa-
chusetts are furnished by the Commonwealth wit the means of substantiating their just claims whic our State does not accord its citizens.
4. To ensure the means of the proof of ag with reference to the prevention of election an other frauds.
5. To assist the State in arriving at correct con-
clusions with regard to measures of internal econ-
omy, taxation, employment and commerce.
6. To furnish a record which is always availabl in tracing the gynealogy of persons or families.—■
Dr. A G. Toung, Augusta, Maine Decatur Burning Everything That Cam in Contact With Yellow Fever Decatur, Ala., April 1.—The citizens of De-
catur, having totally failed in their efforts to se-
cure any aid from our State Health Officer, Dr Jorotne Cochrane, for the purpose of covering th expense of burning all the infected bedding, etc.,
have pluckily gone to work and taken up a sub-
scription from our own people sufficient to pay fo the whole thing. Every conceivable thing tha could in any way possibly preserve germs durin the winter has been taken to the cemetery an burned. The Simmons Transfer Company wer busily engaged at this all day. The dead house,
situated in the west corner of the cemetery, whic was built for the purpose of taking yellow feve patients immediately after death, was also burned.

REPORT FOR MARCH, 1889 The month of March presented several anoma-
lous features, among which were the small amoun of rainfall, the small percentage of cloudiness an the absence of the usual high winds. Altogethe the mouth was a very favorable one for the farmer,
and the work of planting and preparation for th coming crops was, at the close, much more ad-
vanced than usual for the season The mean temperature was 49°.1; slightl above the normal for the past seven years, an was the highest mean during that period. Th highest monthly mean was 52°.8, recorded at Mc-
Kenzie. and the lowest was 44°.3, recorded at Cog
Hill. The highest temperature observed was 82°,
on the 14th, at Leeville, and on the 18th, at
"Waynesboro, and was the highost recorded in
March during the past seven years. The lowes temperature observed was 16°, on the 10th, at
Hohenwald, and was the highest March minimu during the above period, oxcopt in 1887. Th highost temperature was recorded on the 17th and
18th and the lowest, with two or three exceptions,
on the 10th. The daily ranges were slightly i excess of the normal. There were two cold wav warnings received during the month, viz.: 15th-
16th, 27th-28th, which were verified The average precipitation for the month was
3.01 inches, which was 1.75 inch less than the
March average for the past seven years, and jus half the average for March of last year. Of thi amouut the eastern division received an averag of about two and a half inches, the middle divisio about three inches and the western division abou three and three-fourths inches. The greater por-
tion of the amount fell during the latter half o the mouth, the 18th and 19th showing the great-
est amount. After the rain of the 1st and 2d,
which was generally heavy, until the 18th, ther was a period of almost entire absence of rainfall.

gan to fall; the stones were about the size o partridge eggs. Four miles north of this statio the stones were as large as hens' eggs, and drifte eight feet deep in a valley, and at the presen writing (April 1) is lying four feet deep, and wil remain at least a week longer. A large sack ful of stones was brought to me yesterday. At th same time the severest electrical storm that I hav ever known occurred. The telephone in the Pres office-the central office—was burned out by th lightning; also every wire connected with it.

SUBSCRIPTION, 25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postoflice at Nashville as Second Class Matter Yellow Fever and the United States The outbreak of yellow fever last year in
Florida, which rapidly rose to an event o national note and importance, and th occurrence last month in Sanford, Florida,
of a fatal case, has given this topic re-
newed interest to the American public, an specially to the people of those district which at any time during the past tw decades have been visited by this pesti-
lence. Certain portions of Tennessee wer so severely scourged by yellow fever in
1878 as to give the State a reputation alto-
gether undeserved. The excessive alar manifested by two of the great cities of
Tennessee last year has renewed this fals and malign reputation Tennessee, like New York, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Kentucky, and many other States,
has good reason to be on its guard agains this exotic pest. But while exercising al prudential caution, as does New York espe-
cially, it should like that great State be an feel perfectly impregnable During many years of the past century,
and even as late as 1823, the city of New
York was at intervals visited by epidemic which, looking at the ratio of population,
were quite as terrible as that of New Orlean in 1853, or of Memphis in 1878. To-day
New York is in constant and uninterrupte intercourse with Cuba and other tropica habitats of yellow fever, and no one dream of scare The same statement applies to Philadel-
phia, which in 1798 was the theatre of  terrible epidemic. This commenced August
1st and ended November 1st, with a mor-
tality of 3,500, being 1 in 15.50 of th entire population. Philadelphia does no appear so vigilant as New York city, and a late as 1853 had a spurt, commencing July
10th, ending October; mortality, 128 The curious fact that during the close o the last and the beginning of the presen century yellow fever prevailed in the citie of the northeast, while the cities of th southwest were exempt, and the subsequen change in the record, New York and Phila-
delphia escaping, while New Orleans and
Memphis have been severely scourged, ha much impressed historical and medical in-
vestigators The solution of the enigma is clea enough: Sanitary improvements and pre-
cautions on the one hand and neglect o these on the other. New York and Phila-
delphia have grown from moderate towns to-
take rank with the grandest cities of the

world, and yet are healthier than formerly Our Southern towns and villages have grow into cities, and have too often become pes centres. There is hardly a clean city o village in the South. Personally, we kno not one. Atlanta comes nearest the mar of any lately visited. There is scarcely  hamlet even the soil of which is not satu-
rated by infusion of decomposing huma excreta, or in which the inhabitants do no breathe, during the susceptible hours o sleep, an atmosphere contaminated by ex-
halations from accumulated pits or heaps o decaying foecal matter. When the Anglo-
Saxon first dwelt in said localities, whateve else he suffered from, yellow fever let hi alone. When these localities are restore to pristine purity of soil and air, yello fever will again let him alone. We nee not worry ourselves about the epidemic con-
stitution of the atmosphere, or other occul causes of pestilence, when one so paten and so potent is everlastingly thrust unde our eyes and up our nostrils.
TENNESSEE NOT A YELLOW FEVER STATE New Orleans, during the summer of 1853,
was visited by the most dreadful pestilenc known in its annals. This pestilence als spread far and wide throughout the con-
tiguous and tributary regions. Yet durin that season Memphis was a city of refuge In a very able "Report on the Health and
Mortality of the City of Memphis for the
Year 1853," a large edition of which wa published by the Board of Aldermen, an which was written by Charles T. Quintard,
M. D., then professor in the Memphis
Medical College, occur passages which,
when read by the light of 1867, 1873, 1878
and 1879, are intensely interesting and ful of significant warning to a very large exten of country now reposing in fancied security During that period of desolation and dis-
may in the lower Mississippi country n quarantine regulations were adopted by th municipal authorities, although boats wer landing the sick and dying at the whar nearly every day from New Orleans an other towns below Memphis. Sixty-tw cases were carried from the landing to th hospital, many of, them in a dying condi-
tion. Of these thirty-six proved fatal,
twenty dying within twenty-four hours afte admission. Surely the pest in its mos violent form. No wonder that the goo people of Memphis congratulated them-
selves, and felt that they could safely reiter-
ate the opinion expressed in a report of th previous year, "that yellow fever has neve originated this high up the Mississippi, an that there are no causes in our locality fo originating it."
This statement was true of Memphis, an of all Tennessee in 1853, and it is beyon question true this day yellow fever doe not originate in Tennessee The Report goes on to say: "We believ the principal cause of the great healthful-
ness of our city during the past year is t be found in the salubrity of its location,
and we feel that the corporate authoritie can have no higher duty to perform tha the preservation of this healthfulness. Upo it depends the interest of every departmen of industry."
Here is another noteworthy sentence,
which with the above ought to be clubbe into the head of all municipal authorities in
Tennessee by constant reiteration until sai authorities bestir themselves to action: "I is, then, not a vain boast that Memphis i naturally a place of undoubted healthful-
ness, and all that is required for the main-
tenance of its reputation is that degree o attention to the common sense regulations o sanitary police that have secured to othe cities immunity against diseases that origi-
nated in those causes which it is the ver object of a medical police to remove."
Had the plain axiomatic principles o sanitary science so clearly stated, and s powerfully enforced by the able physician of Memphis in 1853, and later seconde also by her prominent merchants, been

heeded, how very different would have bee the subsequent history of that naturall favored site!
In 1867 came the first epidemic; mor-
tality, 231. Next in 1873 a fearful visita-
tion, commencing September 14th, ending
November 9th; mortality, 2,000. And in
1878 its world-famous plague, 17,600 cases;
deaths, 5,150. This was followed by tha of 1879, commencing July 5th, declared a an end October 25th; cases, 1,595 ; deaths,
497; and gave Memphis a blow perhap more severe than was ever inflicted by  single plague upon any one city. Spreadin through ignorance and carelessness as it di to many towns in West Tennessee, an scourging the mountain-girted city of Chat-
tanooga, it also gave the entire State of
Tennessee a reputation for insalubrity totall undeserved. But for yellow fever Memphi would long ago have reached its five-scor thousand. But for yellow fever the farmin lands of Tennessee would be full ten year ahead of their present slow appreciation But for yellow fever life insurance woul have been within reach of thousands no debarred from its beneficent action. I should be reiterated again and again that
Tennessee is not a yellow fever State a whi more than it is a cholera State. Neithe the plague of Hindoostan nor that of Cub can get within our borders or spread therein
•without gross and inexcusable culpability o the part of the people and their servants,
the constituted public authorities In the last twenty years very grea progress has been made as to how to pre-
vent the introduction and the spread o communicable diseases. The pestilence n longer walketh in darkness. Whatever o mystery may still environ its conception an birth, its beginnings are understood, and it progress may be stayed. We know how i travels. We know how to meet it. Isola-
tion, Disinfection, Sanitation are our watch-
words of defense. Isolation of the indi-
vidual affected, or from the community in-
fected. Disinfection of poisonous deject or contaminated articles. Sanitation o dwellings and surroundings. Twenty year from this time our people will look bac upon the terrors of 1878 and the panics of
1888 with wonderment that so glorious  natural paradise as Tennessee should eve have been the theatre of such tragic scenes,
or such irrational scares.
THE INTERIOR VALLEY NOT SAFE Freedom from panic does not involv fatal carelessness. When yellow fever pre-
vails in any of the Gulf or Atlantic States,
the Appalachian mountain chain, with it high elevations and autumnal midsumme climate, now so easily accessible by numer-
ous railroads, should furnish places of refug for those who desire to leave an infecte neighborhood. The large lowns and citie on the Ohio and the Mississippi, or thei tributaries, should be avoided. The expe-
rience of 1878 fortifies this position Louisville, Kentucky, furnished a mos interesting lesson. Eminent medical pro-
fessors in August maintained the absolut immunity of that populous city from yello fever. Her gates and doors were throw wide open to those fleeing from the dreadfu plague. Her Board of Health declared
"That any attempt at quarantine would no only be galling and detrimental to socia and commercial interests, but would also b inhuman in the extreme." The daily pres all along maintained the immunity of Louis-
ville, and refused to believe its existence i their city. When the storm was over th true state of the case came out from the
"Report of Dr. E. O. Brown," the abl physician of the yellow fever hospital, whos calm heroism and scientific skill met wit high commendations from his fellow-citizens He states that several indigenous cases wer admitted and treated from the infected dis-
tricts of the city, four of whom died.
'' These cases were among the most malig-
nant and fatal cases of yellow fever treate in the hospital, as shown by the tests known

before and after death. In all these fou cases we found in the blood and breat large numbers of active vibras or livin germs. I can safely say that if these wer not cases of yellow fever, we admitted non to our hospital from the South. ... I this connection I will here say that ther were fifty or more cases of yellow feve originated in what is called the infected dis-
trict, of which twenty-eight died. . .  Opposite the northwest corner of Elevent and Maple streets the baggage-room of the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad is sit-
uated, where a large amount of baggage,
movables, bedding, etc., were stored, som of which remained there for a number o days. Many of those that contracted th disease were employed in some capacit about the depot. After a careful survey o the locality and its surroundings, and  close study of the cause, I am forced to th conclusion that the disease was transmitte to the inhabitants of this district by infec-
tion, and that the disease is infectious an portable I am thoroughly convinced, no only from what transpired in this particula locality, but from a careful study of th case of the steamer Porter and her barges."
It is evident that in 1878 Louisville nar-
rowly missed the experience of Chatta-
nooga. It is also evident that under  favorable concatenation of circumstance that beautiful city may witness such scene as in the past have given certain years sa memorability in New York, Philadelphia,
New Orleans and Memphis Dr. T. C. Minor, formerly Health Office of Cincinnati, in a vaiuable "Report on
Yellow Fever in Ohio," mentions severa indigenous cases as occurring in Cincinnati Perhaps many others would have followe but for the timely precautions used. At
Gallipolis, Ohio, the disease became epi-
demic, and very fatal. Hence, Dr. Minor,
though in 1877 taking the ground that yel-
low fever had never appeared in Ohio, an holding the almost unanimous opinion of th medical profession, that Cincinnati woul never be subjected to an epidemic of yello fever, for the reason that its altitude an. climate were such as to prevent the devel-
opment of indigenous cases, states (1889)
that his views have been materially modi-
fied within the short space of one year Some little personal experience with th disease during the summer just past (1878)
has caused this radical change of opinion The results at Bowling Green in 1878 ar also most instructive. This at that tim small but most beautifully situated city i the junction of the Memphis branch of the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad with th main stem. Relying upon its great salu-
brity and the lofty hills in and around it limits, refugees from West Tennessee wer freely admitted, with clothing, baggage, etc Car-loads of these were in or around th station at intervals and for varying period of time. Result, such a spat of the diseas as renders the people of Bowling Gree very keenly alive to the dangers of yello fever Chattanooga, then as now the gateway o the South, with proverbial indifference t the warnings of its able physicians, was i a very unsanitary condition. Nevertheless,
relying also upon altitude and climate, i invited the frightened fugitives to halt an enjoy her hospitality. Dearly was thi ignorance and thoughtlessness punished b a fearful pestilence, which, commencing
September 1, 1878, scattered her people t the four winds until autumnal frosts mad it safe to return Nashville, between Bowling Green and
Chattanooga, ventured upon an experimen which gave her no small fame and man plaudits at the time. There was absolut freedom of traffic and travel. Chattanooga,
Bowling Green and all West Tennessee sen their refugees by scores, who were all heart-
ily welcomed. On the other hand, the cit and outlying suburbs were put in perfec sanitary condition by the expenditure of

over seven thousand dollars. An infirmary,
with skilled nurses and physicians was pro-
vided. During the season twenty-four case occurred among the refugees and thirtee deaths. A number of the deaths were i private houses and in widely separated por-
tions of the city. In each case thoroug disinfection by fire and otherwise was prac-
ticed. No well authenticated instance of a indigenous case occurred. Yet those con-
ducting this experiment, who also receive unanimous and warm thanks from the peopl of Nashville for their brilliant success, i their "Report," published 1879, take occa-
sion to say: "If next summer, or in an subsequent summer, Memphis and othe towns in West Tennessee or elsewhere ar in danger from the yellow fever poison, le the people scatter, and that speedily. Le them also avoid cities, more especially ver large cities, in an uncleanly state, or situate in very low bottoms, for without very grea care in those localities the poison carried b them may spread. Again, it is natural tha the inhabitants of cities like St. Louis, Cin-
cinnati and Chicago, do not desire to b visited by crowds of refugees from a yello fever region, for should this fearful pesti-
lence once break out in these densely packe and imperfectly hygienized cities, the dam-
age done to life, and property would be in-
calculable. Even such cities as Nashville,
Clarksville, Murfreesboro, Columbia and
Knoxville should not be overcrowded wit such refugees. Certainly not without th utmost care . gainst infected articles, an the most complete exercise of sanitar purity American Resorts, with Notes Upon Their
Climate By Bushrod W. James, A. M., M. D. Philadel-
phia and London, 1889 This is the title of an octavo volume of
300 pages, intended for invalids and thos who desire to preserve good health in  suitable climate. Its author has given muc attention to sanitary topics, and has com-
piled this book for the general public, a well as the medical profession. It is an in-
teresting summary of a very wide field. Th principal mountain and seaside resorts an mineral springs pass in rapid review. Sum-
mer and winter resorts receive attention Full stress is laid upon the connection o climate with disease and cure. Mexico and
South America, as well as the High North,
are included in this treatise equally with the
United States. Tennessee makes a ver modest appearance. No pains having bee taken by our own people to give her the re-
pute she should enjoy as a sanitarium, w have only ourselves to blame. Only tw places are specially mentioned—Cloudlan among the mountain resorts, and Montval among the mineral springs Criminal Neglect. ,
No man is entitled to a home unless he ca make that home happy and healthful. He has n right to bo the means of bringing misery to other or leave posterity the legacy of ill-health or con-
stitutional weakness. It is the duty of all to b healthy, and so observe the laws of hygiene tha they may contribute the full measure of their in-
dividual well being to the public good. His indif-
ference or neglect of health laws and the observ-
ance of the sanitation of his home is not only  crime against himself, but the infliction of a wron on the public and a burden on posterity In this country, with its plan of society and in-
tercourse, no family is isolated. Whatever condi-
tions may produce disease in one family are ofte responsible for sickness in others. Cases are re-
corded where disease has had its origin traced t very remote causes, both as to time and place,
and these causes have been found to be the resul of neglect in the proper care of the home. Th fact that such cases are not always found in th homes of the destitute and ignorant is evidenc that in families of the well-to-do and culture there is a want of the observance of the simples sanitary precautions, which, we are constrained t believe', results more from neglect and indifferenc than from ignorance of the means to he employed Fourth Annual Report of the Kansas State Boar of Health, page 8 Havana and Filth The city of Havana has a population estimate at two hundred and four thousand. It is bu partly drained. Old-time privies and cesspool poison the air and soak the earth with tceca poisons Its whole sub-soil is contaminated. When in
Havana in November of the year previous, I pur-
posely visited the docks near La Machina, in th vicinity of the custom house, where the entranc to the harbor is narrow, and where the vesselB fo want of space lie side by side. There I notice that in the dirty waters occasional hubbies aros to the surface to discharge their foul gases, tellin of fermentation far below. In the very thick o this sewage the vessels and the sailing ships ar found In them yellow fever makes constant ravages a all seasons of the year, particularly in the hot

months. We owe much to commerce and rapi transit. We are also indebted to it for epidemic of yellow fever. With proper sanitary precaution the southern United States would be free from al future epidemics of yellow jack. But will the bef I doubt it. Why f Because "corporation have no souls to damn and no backs to kick," an because mankind is selfish and grasping in th search for riches The entrance to the harbor of Havana require special mention. To place this word sketch be-
fore you clearly, let me give full details. Th entrance to the harbor may be six hundred fee across. The harbor may be described as a smal salt lake, perhaps a mile and a half or two mile long, by three-fourths of a mile across its broades part. The entrance to the harbor is guarded b the old - time historic fortifications, called El
Morro. Just opposite, or across the entrauce, ar other fortifications, covered with hugh siege guns,
on the city side. Remember, the narrow, gate-
like entrance, a mere water lane, and beyond th harbor, receiving all the filth and sewage men-
tioned. As oue would expect who has travele in the West Indies, Mexico, Central and South
America, Havana, owing to the old-time closets,
want of drainage, sub-soil contamination, etc., i a disease-producing and distributing center. Th air in certain sections recks with the vile faeca odor so familiar to all travelers in Spanish-Ameri-
can cities within the tropics. Huge street grating ventilate the few drains, and the reeking odor almost stifle one in the crowded centers. Thes drains are never flushed, except by the heav rains, and if flushed would only empty their fer-
menting contents into the bay below.
A mere reference to fn'cal fermentation withi the tropics to all students of disease is ample,
without entering into specific details. I may ad inter alia that there are some students of yello fever who believe—and undoubtedly their belief i a just one—that the focal matter from yellow feve patients is as essentially dangerous as are th stools from typhoid fever patients. The point I
wish to make, and impress upon my readers, i this: That the poison of yellow fever is just a much a part and parcel of the city of Havana a the houses and churches of New York are a par of that noble city. I make bold to state that th yellow fever poison is as much an article of expor from that island as are its famous cigars. Whil tho harbor is foul and dangerous, the city is th habitat of vellow jack.—Dr. Wolfrcd Nelson, Feb-
ruary 22, 1889 Cleanliness and Quarantine Proposition—In a warm climate continued clean-
liness is the best safeguard against yellow fever Question First—Granted an unsanitary condi-
tion of a town, as Macclenny or Jacksonville, ma yellow lever originate spontaneously?
Answer—No! The advanced doctrine is, "N germ, no yellow fever;" but, inasmuch as th germ has not been found, let the chance b divided Question Second—Granted an unsanitary condi-
tion of a town, city or residence, and the importa-
tion of yellow fever germ, what will be th result?
Answer—The result will be yellow fever Question Third—Granted a city, town or localit kept continuously clean, free from all "foci," wil yellow fever become epidemic, importation or no-
importation of germ?
Answer—No! A place may be kept yello fever proof Corollary — An unsanitary condition gives  chance and a half for yellow fever. A sanitar condition gives none.
I know it is held by many physicians that  rigid quarantine is the best preventive against yel-
low fever. That the disease is spread by germs i true; but that it is impossible to prevent the in-
troduction of germs from abroad by the presen modes of quarantine is fully proved by the past Iu the first place, it is necessary to know wha places are to be quarantined against. But th germs may be brought from a place where th yellow fever is not known to exist To prevent panic and the loss of trade the firs appearance of the disease is invariably kept secret,
in the hope that it may be stamped out before i becomes epidemic, and thus the germs may b scattered far and wide before any warning is given Then the system of quarantine now in use is s onerous that all means are tried to evade it; an if but one person passes having the germs of dis-
ease, all the labor and annovauce has been iu vain Not that quarantine should be abandoned; kee out the germs as far as possible, but provide tha if, despite all precautions, they are iutroduced,
they will fall upon clean places, where they can-
not propagate. Treasure quarantine, but make i pleasant and not hateful.—Dr. IV. C. VauBibber Prevention of Yellow Fever Unclean Villages.
I am personally quite familiar with this subjec from actual observation in many of the cities an towns in the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, New York, the Dominion of Canada,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and 1 may add Florida also.
I know that the yards uttached to houses are,
for the most part, from one hundred to one hun-
dred and fifty feet deep, more or less, and are gen-
erally surrounded with decaying board fence eight feet high and these enclosed yards bnv been, as a rule, the receptacles for all" the refus matters of families for a long time. Thus it wil readily be seen that they affect the air of thos dwellings which are near to them, as well as thos to which they are attached From an eminence in the State of Mississippi I
once beheld a beautiful village, which, when see in the early morning, with cluster roses and creep-
ers covering the roofs of its houses, looked like  fairy city of enchantment. Who would have sup-
posed, from the distance at which I stood, that i was then the abode of a deadly yellow fever pesti-
lence? Its board-screened yards, undrained, leve and water-soaked, were filled with things offensiv and useless, which sheer carelessness had allowe to accumulate Its cemetery was daily being filled from no othe cause than the neglect of its inhabitants. It ma be answered therefore that cities and towns, espe-
cially in a warm climate, which are built and kep in a manner similar to what has been described,
cannot be said to have come up to the standard o continued cleanliness.—Dr. W. C. Van Bibber, Pre-
vention of Yellow Fever.

tainting the air, wells poisoned by undergroun drainage from cesspools, or the inadequately fil-
tered water of the larger cities, murdering by de-
grees every one within the town; think further o the lameutable ignorance concerning the conse-
quences of these things among the many in tow and country; and then I will ask, is it not mee and right and the bounden duty of every govern-
ment to interfere in these matters 1 Is it not im-
perative that each State shall enact and enforce,
rigidly, laws that shall rid the land of its contam-
inating filth?
Scattered among the masses are many who d know, and fully realize, the terrible consequence of this criminal neglect, who try with all thei power to keep things about them sweet and clean,
and who yet are compelled to breathe the sur-
rounding atmosphere, filled with its poison, unles they cease forever to breathe, as very many do;
many who, perchance, have to watch by th death-bed of a loved one, dying of some filth dis-
ease, such as typhoid fever, diphtheria, etc.,
caused by neighbors' filth—murdered, just as muc as if these criminally-negligent neighbors had will-
fully killed the poor sufferer, and yet who mus quietly submit, and listen to a Iouk rigmarole o the dispensations of Providence, as they consig the precious forms of the dear ones to the cold,
cold grave. Providence, indeed! Filth, my kin hearers; nothing but tilth. I have no patienc with this " Hand of Providence" preaching in th affairs of men, when nine times out of ten man' troubles come through his own or somebody' thoughtlessness Haviug lived in one of these new Western towns
(not that towns in other localities are any better),
where there has never been any serious attemp at sanitary measures, and by force of circum-
stances obliged to live in the thickest settled por-
tion of the city, and where, during the heate term, life at times has seemed anything but desir-
able, I know whereof I write. I have talked an talked, and even begged through the columns o the weekly newspapers, that something might b done; have publicly told those in authority whe some dread scourge was doing its worst that i was caused by criminal neglect, yet never a re-
sponse worthy the name; perhaps one or two reek-
ing vaults in my immediate vicinity have bee covered up, an obnoxious pig-pen removed, is all
I have accomplished ; and in my extremity I hav longed for higher power to appeal to. And ye how soon a ibree of men with an orderly, clea housewife as overseer, could cleanse and renovat any small town, if every, mau could but see th necessity or be made to see it.—Mrs. J. M. Pat-
ten, in Fourth Annual Report of the Kansas State
Board of Health, page 126 Prevention of Epidemics Dr. Budd, of Bristol. England, who died a fe years ago, after a large and extended experienc as a physician and hygienist, was able to say that
"For a period of nearly twenty years, durin which I have been employed in a very large field,
I have never known scarlet fevor to spread in  single instance beyond the sick-room, and in  very few iustances within it." The rules which h laid down to accomplish so favorable a result wit a disease so infoctious were few and simple, bu imperative. They were essentially the same a those which are now generally employed by loca authorities in all parts of the world, and by mean of which they meet with an amount of succes commensurate with the wisdom of the laws, th efficiency of the local officers, and the intelligen co-operation of the people at large. What is sai of scarlet fever is equally true of diphtheria,
typhoid fever and measles.—Fourth Annual Repor of Kansas State Board of Health,
Light.
A dark house is almost always unhealthy; al-
ways an ill-aired house. Want of light stop growth, and promotes scrofula, rickets, consump-
tion, etc., especially among children. Peopl lose their health in a dark house, and if they go ill they cannot get well again in it.—Florence
Nightingale, Fourth Annual Report of Kansas

REPORT FOR APRIL, 1889 The principal meteorological features for Apri were the prevalence of high winds, the smal amount of rainfall and the small percentage o cloudiness. The month was generally very favor-
able for the advancement of farm work The mean temperature was 59°.9, very slightl in excess of the average of the past seven years The highest monthly mean was 60°.7, recorded at

Of this amount the Eastern divisio received an average of about two and a hal inches, the Middle division a little more tha that, while the Western division received onl about two inches. Nearly three-fourths of thi amount fell on the four days—12th to 15th, in-
clusive. These rains, also those of the 1st, 20th,
24th and 30th, were general rains; the others wer very light and local in character. The rain of the

Lawrenceburg on the llth At Lawrenceburg the kingbird appeared on the
9th, and the catbird on the 13th Fireflies appeared at Riddleton and Nunnelly o the 9th The observer at Greeneville reports that sno fell on the TJnaka Mountains on the 28th, an could be seen until noon on the 29th. Snow wa also reported on the same mountains, forty mile south of Knoxville, on the 28th and 29th The observer at RogerBville reports that fores fires prevailed from the 6th to the llth, and ex-
tended over a large territory along the Clinch
Mountains, doing but little damage, except t timber The observer at Nunnelly reports that fores fires prevailed in the vicinity of that station fro the 3d to the 6th The rainfall at Knoxville was the least recorde for April during the eighteen years beginning with
1871, the next being 1.93 inch, in 1885. Th greatest April rainfall during that period was in
1874, when the unprecedented fall of 17.32 inche was recorded The deficiency in rainfall for the four months,
from January 1st, at the U. S. Signal Stations, a shown by the table elsewhere, is as follows:
Knoxville, 8.71 inches; Chattanooga, 7.85 inches;
Nashville, 10.01 inches; Memphis, 7.41 inches Sergt. L. M. Pindell, TJ. S. Observer at Chatta-
nooga, furnishes the following data of rainfall fo the month at stations outside the State: Murphy,
N. C, 2.33 inches; Asheville, N. C, 1.15 inch;
Charleston, N. C, 1.74 inch Sergt. J. B. Marbury, TJ. S. Observer at Nash-
ville, kindly furnishes the following notes con-
cerning a remarkable meteor observed by him:
"At 11.15 p. m., on the 22d, a most brillian meteor was observed passing from the northeas quadrant of the heavens. It apparently starte at an altitude of 20°, and passed rapidly up to th zenith, where it seemed to hesitate for a second,
and suddenly shoot off across the sky in a south-
east direction, forming an angle of about 80° The track was marked by a stream of silver light of dazzling brilliancy. Prom the northeas side of this track sparks of light were thrown oi at intervals, indicating that the motion of th meteor was circular, as well as forward, th sparks being thrown from the body by centrifuga force. During the time it remained in the zenit a very distinct corona, about 8° in diameter, wa noticed. Prom this it would seem that the change,
of course, was due to an increased gyratory mo-
tion, caused by sudden contact with some dens and impenetrable substance, which finally force it off to the east-southeast, where less resistanc was found. The meteor disappeared at 11.16
p. m."
The Sergeant also makes the following summar for the month at his station:
■'The average atmospheric pressure was some-
what lower than the normal for the past sixteen-
years. The highest barometer, 30.46, occurre on the 7th, accompanied by a slight cold wave,
which reduced the temperature to 33°, the min-
imum for the month. The temperature was-
slightly in excess of the normal—maximum tem-
perature, 85° on the llth. On the 12th Nashville-
was in the southeast quadrant of a low barometri area, which caused the severe hail storm and heav rain accompanied by a thunder storm. A col wave signal was ordered np on the 3d, the only-
one during the month. A second (distant) thunde storm occurred on the 24th. The total rainfall fo the month, 2.83 inches, is, with the exception of
1886, the smallest amount recorded for April dur-
ing the past eighteen years. So far this has bee an exceptionally dry season, there being a defi-
ciency of over ten inches since January 1 The observer at Riddleton makes the followin notes: "One of the most remarkable thunder an rain storms at this station for several years was.
that of the 12th, in which 2.01 inches of rain an hail fell in the space of throe hours—the greate portion in one hour, and over 1.50 inches fell be-
tween 3.50 and 4.30 p. m., as recorded by the self-
registering-rain gauge at this station. The barom-
eter and thermometer both fell very fast durin the storm—the thermometer fell from 80° to 62°
in thirty minutes. The storm was accompanie with heavy gusts of wind from west southwest,
blowing at the rate of 35 to 40 miles per hour for  few minutes, although tho highest hourly velocit was 19 miles. The heavy fall of rain did a grea deal of damage, washing hill-side lands badly an flooding bottom lands. The hail storm accom-
panying the rain lasted from 3.50 to 5 p. m.—th stones were as large as marbles. (What sized mar-
bles, Prank?—Ed.) In drift places bushels o stones could have been gathered up. Hail also fel on the 24th from 11.50 p. m. to 12.10 a. m. on the
25th, the stones were small but fell very fast. Th month has been, altogether, very favorable for th seeding and growing of crops, the temperatur being very near the normal for the past six years,
while the rainfall was considerably in excess—0.98
inch. The wind movement was slightly above th normal, although there were no severe velocitie recorded."
The observer at Springdale makes the followin notes: "Corn is coming up badly; a large pe cent of young clover has died; oats, clover an meadows look badly; wheat has also been hurt t some extent by the dry weather. Peaches hav fallen off until there seems to be not more tha half a crop on the trees; cherries also have falle some; apples in abundance—the crop is the larges ever known in this county—almost every goo farmer has a young orchard of standard trees tha come into bearing this year for the first timo.''
The observer at Nunnelly makes the followin notes: "April has been variable—high winds pre-
vailing throughout the month—light rains fallin about the middle of the month, the first and latte parts dry, the latter very dry with cool nights,
which checked the growth of crops. Cut worm*
doing considerable damage to corn, Colorad beetles doing some damage to potatoes, caterpillar*
denuding the wild cherry trees of leaves and doing-
some damage also to peach and apple trees."
The observer at Parksville notes as follows:
"This has been a very dry month, and clover an oats have suffered, but a good stand of com has

The observer at Watkins notes as follows:
“Some fruit has been killed that was thought safe,
especially apples. Plenty of peaches yet, but I
have not seen a single one that has not been stun by the curculio. All crops looking fine, but mor rain needed."
The observer at Clarksville reports that on the
12th a high wind prevailed-hail reported in som parts of the county, and a very heavy hail stor in the adjacent parts of Kentucky The observer at Austin reports on the 24th heav hail three to four miles north of station, accom-
panied by heavy rain, thunder and diffuse lightning The observer at Woodstock reports the hailstor of the 12th quite severe in other sections of Shelb county, north and east The observer on Lookout Mountain says that o the 4th at 2 p. m. the only north wind during th month was noted, and the only northwest wind o the 25th at 9 p. m As will be seen by the tabulated reports, thre new stations have been added to the list, viz. :
Dunlap, Sequachee county, in charge of Mr. Lewis
Boynton, our former faithful and efficient observe at Farmingdale; McMinnville, Warren county, i charge of Prof. E. W. Doran, State Entomologist,
and Tullahoma, Coffee county, in charge of Mr Ed. S. Jones, editor of The Progressive Age. Al these give promise of much good to the service, a they are in the hands of competent men It is the painful duty of the Assistant Directo to announce the death of Mr. Charles Foster, of
Fostoria, who was one of the original voluntar observers of the Weather Service in the State Mr. Foster died on the 25th of February, at th ripe age of 87 years-a faithful, conscientious,

SUBSCRIPTION, - 25c PER ANNUM Entered at Postoffice at Nashville as Second Class Matter On the Appalachian Health Resorts of
Tennessee Time out of mind mineral waters hav enjoyed great repute with the people, be-
cause of real or reputed efficacy as thera-
peutic agents. Waters and baths in th luxurious period of the Roman emperors,  period of profligacy and decline, were i constant use by the wealthy of that time Names of favorite resorts in Europe at thi day are memorials of that time, as we hav more than one Aix In our day, salt water and sea-shore ai have caused the opening of a vast numbe of health resorts on both continents High mountains, because of scenery an climate, now divide the public patronag with mineral springs and sea bathing. O late years, mountains have grown so rapidl in favor with invalids as well as with stou tourists, as to justify the appellation of in-
dustrial resources to the atmosphere sur-

rounding these ordinarily sterile height no less than to the rich metallic ores con-
cealed within their depths In 1848 we saw the White Mountains of
New Hampshire visited by hundreds and!
bringing rich revenues to the few hostelries-
and scattered farms of the narrow valleys in*
that region. In i860 we saw thousands-
there, filling to overflowing many larg hotels, and scattering gold far and wide Now, hundreds of thousands annually visi these bleak hills, crowd immense palatia hotels, and distribute money by the million In Switzerland, between the period of ap-
proach by horse power some years since,
and by s'eam power more recently, we hav seen a like wonderful change. All Europ pays tribute to that mountain land, to whic also America sends a large tribute East of the Rocky Mountains no State i so favored with sites for mountain healt resorts of every variety and purpose as is ou own ribbon-shaped Tennessee, by reason o the Appalachian chain which falls withi her limits. Hitherto, inaccessibility ha caused this magnificent region to be over-
looked. The great lines of railway now i process of construction will, at an early day,
penetrate this huge mass of mountains wit eight or ten thoroughfares, bringing it withi a few hours reach of nearly all the grea cities of the interior valley, gulf, and south
Atlantic coasts. To the cities of Tennesse and circumjacent States these Appalachian will furnish the nearest and cheapest healt resorts. It is time that the medical an general public of Tennessee should becom buSItin.

acquainted with the beauty and value of thi hitherto slighted region Dr. Gerard Troost, the eminent pionee geologist of Tennessee, in his reports upon
Sevier and Cocke Counties, as far back as
1837, dwelt upon the great future of East
Tennessee, and followed up the topic i subsequent papers printed in American and
European scientific periodicals. He alway maintained that the East was the wealthies and leading division of the State, and tim is rapidly demonstrating his thesis.
GENERAL FEATURES As far back as 1819, Mr. John H. Kain,
of Tennessee, in a contribution to Silli-
man's Journal, vol. 1, p. 60, gives an out-
line of this region, the accuracy of which i readily verified by the most casual ob-
server:
"The most prominent as well as the mos beautiful features of this country, is tha succession of mountain and valley, ridg and vale, which we meet with in traversin its surface.
"The grand range of Alleghany Moun-
tains enters Virginia about the 39th degre of north latitude, and, pursuing a south-
western course, spreads out upon the eas end of Tennessee and terminates near th southern boundary line of that State, in the
Alabama territory, and about the 34th par-
allel of north latitude. In this view ar included the Blue Mountains, the North
Mountains, the Alleghany (properly s called), the Cumberland, Clinch, Iron, and
Smoky Mountains, together with a variet of smaller mountains, spurs and ridges, al running parallel to each other, from th northeast to the southwest, and all, I be-
lieve I may say, covered with forests, an presenting to the eye of the naturalist  most interesting field for speculation an improvement.
"With a few exceptions, the geologis meets with none of those remarkable ap-
pearances which indicate the changes an convulsions which have been wrought b time, the great enemy of nature. Occa-
sionally we are presented with a view of  sublime precipice, formed by sections whic a river appears to have made for itsel through an opposing mountain; and th large masses of ruins which he scattere around such a place, seem, to the imagina-
tion of the solitary traveler, the historica records of commotions, awful even in retro-
spect. Most commonly, however, the moun-
tains seem to have lain for ages in undis-
turbed repose, and the streams of water,
when they have crossed them, have sough an easy passage through the ravines, whic do not so often divide a mountain, or ridge,
at right angles, as wind between the ends o two opposing spurs which pass each other,
gradually declining into the champaign coun-
try at their mutual base. Through thi whole extent of country we rarely meet wit any remarkable falls of water; the obviou reason of which is, that the rocks are s soft they are easily worn down to the leve of the beds of rivers. But shoals, or shal-
lows, are frequent, and are formed by bed of rounded sandstone, spread out into  broad base, over which the water ofte rushes with no small violence and noise.
"The mountains are generally, thoug not always, sterile, and produce nothing bu forest trees; but the valleys are, with hardl an exception, rich, and productive of ever variety of 'grass and herb-yielding seed,
and fruit-tree yielding fruit.' Nor are the less favored in the mineral kingdom; pos-
sessing the greatest abundance of all th most useful and necessary minerals."
In Killebrew's Resources of Tennessee,
we find a description of this region also quit to our purpose:
"The eastern system of the mountains of
North America is known as the Appalachian
. system. It begins in a broad, low hill, nea the mouth of the St. Lawrence, in Canada,
and keeping approximately parallel to the
Atlantic coast, extends through Vermont,
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, North Carolina and Tennessee, an loses itself in broad, low hills in the norther parts of Georgia and Alabama. The charac-
teristic feature of the whole system is, tha it is made up of parallel ranges, separate by valleys of remarkably uniform width These ranges are not continuous, but ar broken up into stretches of various lengths The outer ranges sink down into low, broa ridges, but maintain, almost without excep-
tion, the general parallelism of the large central ranges. The extreme length of the
Appalachians is about thirteen hundred
(1,300) miles, and the greatest width fro east to west, about one hundred (100)

193
miles. This is about midway the length of
Pennsylvania and Maryland.
"Without the towering height of the Alp or the massive grandeur of the Rocky Moun-
tains, there is still much of interest attachin to the Appalachians to excite the study o men of science. Accordingly, many dis-
tinguished geologists of America and Europ have made a study of different sections o these mountains and have felt well paid fo their labors. But the results of their vari-
ous labors are only to be found in separat reports and society papers, and a full an satisfactory account of the entire system re-
mains yet to be written.
"In each State, local names are given t the various ranges which make up the sys-
tem, and most of the school geographie have created confusion by failing to recog-
nize the fact that these local ranges are bu parts of one grand system. That part o the system which passes through Tennessee,
has been appropriately named the Unaka
Range and the Cumberland Table Land These ranges are in turn composed of vari-
ous subordinate mountains and ridges hav-
ing local names and special features to dis-
tinguish them. The Unaka and the Cum-
berland ranges are moreover separated b the Valley of the Tennessee.
"The Unaka Range lies between the
States of Tennessee and North Carolina, it central crest forming, for the most part, th dividing line between the two States.
"The Valley of East Tennessee is in tur made up of numerous subordinate valleys,
lying almost parallel. So that an orographi view would present the appearance of a grea valley with a floor fluted by low ranges o mountains, running almost parallel with th two great ranges that form the sides.
"The general trend of lhese aanges i from northeast to southwest. At irregula intervals the valley is partially intersected b short ridges or spurs, breaking off from an lying at nearly right angles to them. Thes parallel ranges and transverse ridges exer-
cise a very powerful influence on the climat of East Tennessee. The trend of all th parallel ranges is northeast and southwest,
-while the dip of the floor of the valley i almost uniformly to the southwest. Nea the Virginia line, the elevation of the valle floor is between 1,300 and 1,400 feet, whil near the Georgia line it falls to about 800,
the direct distance being 175 miles. In ad-
dition to this southwesterly dip, the entir plane of the valley has a northwesterly in-
clination, in keeping with the general incli-
nation of the plane of the State.
"On the east, the mountain range which
Prof. Safford has named the Unaka, is by-
far the grandest and most massive chain o mountains east of the Mississippi, and pre-
sents many peculiar and interesting feature but little known. The elevations along the
State line vary from about 6.500 to about
3,000 feet. The Cumberland Mountains or
'Table Land,'lying west of the valley, i much lower and possesses bi't few of thos wild and massive features which characteriz the Unakas. It varies in elevation, alon its easterm rim, from 2,000 to 3,000 feet."
In 1818, the Rev. Elias Cornelius, of New
York, made an extensive geological tou through Virginia, Tennessee, and the Ala-
bama and Mississippi territories, and dwell with the enthusi.ism of a genuine lover o nature upon the beauty of the countr through which he passed, and of its bound-
less future promise. He tersely sums u one of the most remarkable features of Ten-
nessee, in Sillima-n's Journal, vol. 1, p. 221:
"The Cumberland Mountain is a singula formation. It belongs to the class called
'Table Mountains.' Its width varies fro a few miles to more than fifty, its height i not perceptibly different from that of the
Blue Ridge. It forms a circuit, in a shap somewhat resembling a half moon. Wind-
ing to the southwest, it keeps a course nort of the Tennessee River, in some place nearly parallel with it; passes a few miles t the southeast in the Alabama territory, an not long after terminates. At one part,
over which I crossed, the mountain i eighteen miles wide. This is about 150
miles southwest of Knoxville, a little nort of the 35th degree of north latitude."
Dr. Henry O. Marcy, of Boston, on Oct.
29, 1885, read before the American Aoud-
emy of Medicine, New York, an elaborat paper on "The Climatic Treatment of Dis-
ease: Western North Carolina as a Health
Resort." Dr. Marcy is so well known t the medical profession of America as one o its most eminent practitioners, that we shal freely use his work with the hope of awak-
ening at least some of our own busy brethren

to the study of climatology and mountai climbing here at home or next door. Wha he says of this region at large is even mor true of Tennessee than of the Mother State His general summary is excellent:
"The mountains of the Alleghany rang have been known to some extent as afford-
ing interesting and health-giving resorts fo summer recreation, and in the souther ranges furnishing summer homes for the res-
idents of Southern States. The entire rang is free from malaria, and Asheville, in west-
ern North Carolina, has grown to a villag of about 5,000 inhabitants, chiefly as a sum-
mer resort. The Alleghanies divide, in th northern part of North Carolina, into the
Blue Ridge and the Smokies, the latter th boundary line between that State and Ten-
nessee. The triangle thus formed, with
South Carolina and Georgia on the south,
is filled with cross ranges of mountains, an comprises a territory of about 50,000 squar miles. The entire section is elevated in th bed of the streams, or valleys, to about
2,000 feet above the sea, and presents  most irregular surface; a sea of mountai peaks, ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 feet i height. Within an area of fifty miles ther are twenty peaks over 6,000 feet high; nine-
tenths of the entire district is an unbroke primeval forest of the largest growth,chiefl of deciduous trees. It is the oldest geologi-
cal formation on the continent, of graniti character, and gives the most unmistakabl evidence of the corroding tooth of time Not a lake or a swamp is to be found in th entire region, a fact perhaps without a par-
allel for an area of equal extent in th world. Feldspar is the predominating facto in the granite, and owing to its easy decom-
position, the rocks have worn more rapidly,
giving an excellent soil for tree-growth an the purest water, as seen in an endless serie of pearly, musical rivulets.
"With a sparse population, such soil an water, there cannot be otherwise than a pur atmosphere. Owing to the difficulties o making railroads in such a mountainou country, until quite recently, the larger por-
tion of this region has been more inaccessi-
ble than Colorado, and no part of the United
States, east of the Mississippi, equally large,
is prob bly to-day so little known or pos-
sessed of equal natural advantages, so en-
tirely undeveloped.
"The absence of mosquitoes, gnats an black flies will speak volumes in favor o these mountain forests to those who hav sought recreation in the wilds of our borde lands in any direction. The lack of civil-
izing comforts is the present drawback, an the invalid who ventures a residence i these remote mountain recesses must pro-
vide for himself nearly everything approach-
ing a luxury. The lover of nature of eithe sex will find plenty to occupy and fill th hours with delightful study. It is, however,
no place for one seriously ill, and the chroni grumbler will never want for occasion t exercise his spleen. The absence of goo roads and bridges make locomotion difficult The saddle offers the best of exercise an the surest means of travel, but the railroad approaching from every direction give prom-
ise of a new era. The mineral wealth, for-
est growth and productive soil are in evi-
dence of the prosperity to come. The pur air, water and climate hold out a hopefu helpfulness to invalids from every land The wise legislator, seeking far-reaching re-
sults, would do well to consider the advisa-
bility of securing, under State control,  large reservation of the higher ranges as  park. Its cost, at present, would be merel nominal. Like the peaks and glaciers of
Switzerland, its indirect returns of monetar gain would be more sure than bonded inter-
est, and its sanitary advantages would be o a value incalculable to millions yet un-
born."
Having thus given a very brief descrip-
tion of the large extent of country embrace under our caption, and which we purpos very much to enlarge in subsequent num-
bers of the Bulletin, attention is called t the bearings of this topic upon the daily-
practice of medicine Here again we use the thoroughly studie language of Dr. Marcy; calling marked at-
tention to the fact that the whole medica world is beginning to realize and act upor the close connection of climatology wit the cause, prevention and cure of disease.
"Based upon the belief that an asepti atmosphere is of the first importance in th selection of a climate for the benefit of suf-
ferers from a certain class of diseases, exam-
inations of the atmosphere have been care-
fully made to demonstrate its purity. Miguel

and Freudenreich found that mycrophyte were rare at 800 metres, and absolutel wanting at 2,000 metres above the sea level For physical reasons, high altitudes hav been believed to be beneficial in earl phthisics, and, influenced by the latter dem-
onstrations of a bacillary cause, this asepti state of the atmosphere is theoretically ac-
cepted as promising good results, and sani-
tary stations for mountain-air treatment o consumptives have been established at sev-
eral selected points in the Alps, where th comforts of home life are furnished to inva-
lids. Of these health resorts, Davos and
St. Moritz are the most popular. St. Morit is 6,000 feet and Davos is over 5,000 fee above the sea level, and the latter has be-
come noted for winter treatment, althoug the average temperature from November to
March is only 230 Fahr. The number o visitors at Davos last winter (1884-85) wa over i,ooo, and careful provision is mad for home comfort. The patients are urged
-to be active out of doors within the limit o fatigue. Each year adds 10 the number o invalids resorting to these mountain sanita-
ria, and the statistics show good results. I should, however, be borne in mind that th cases sent to these resorts are those selecte in the incipient stages of disease, and this i to be taken into the account in the deduc-
tions that the recoveries average one-fourth;
also the time elapsing after the treatmen has been too short to determine with accu-
racy the results. This pertains in criticis to the statistics of other similar localities,
bat it is by no means an easy task to secur satisfactory data, and such a problem ca never be subjected to a mathematical analy-
sis.
"The chemical and mechanical laws o life have, hitherto, almost entirely engage the attention of investigators in the study o the circumfusa of the invalid. For a num-
ber of years committees from the America and British Medical Associations have bee engaged in securing data for the compariso of the invasion of acute diseases with mete-
orological changes. Although these latte are largely*factors in the problem, they hav a much wider significance than usually sup-
posed, since they make possible condition not only devitalizing to the individual bu favoring in many instances the growth an development of infectious germs. The tide and changes of the great atmospheric ocean,
in which we are submerged, are of the ut-
most significance. Its weight as measure by the barometer, indicates the pressur which our bodies sustain. The moisture i suspension not only increases the weight,
but modifies its influence upon the individ-
ual, and this is measured by the hygrometer The changes of atmospheric temperature, a recorded by the thermometer, are of well-
recognized importance.
"The atmosphere also varies in its com-
position, of which, from our present stand-
point of consideration, oxygen and ozon may he accepted as the most significant,
since these agents materially lessen th growth and development of all the mycro-
scopic forms of plant life. From the ob-
servations of a number of our most compe-
tent physiologists, it is probable that th amount of oxygen absorbed in health doe not greatly vary whether the individual is a the sea level or at high altitudes. If this i correct, the accepted belief of increase oxygenation of the blood from breathing a air rich in oxygen, as at the sea level, is no true.
"The effect upon the individual of a ozonized atmosphere is generally concede to be beneficial, yet, unfortunately, less i known upon this subject than is desired;
its antiseptic properties are well recognized,
and its influence upon the purity of the at-
mosphere, if not upon the individual, is un-
doubted. Ozone owes its great influence t its powerful oxydizing qualities. The com-
pounds of ammonia, phosphorus and sul-
phur are acted upon with great rapidity, an the odors resulting from animal decomposi-
tion are removed almost instantly. It i probably destructive to all the minute veg-
etable organisms, when in active develop-
ment, but its effect in destroying the vitalit of their spores has not been yet ascertained This has its direct bearing upon the questio of climate, since it has been pretty well de-
termined that all the varieties of pathogeni microbes not only do not thrive, but fail t live, except within a narrow range of con-
ditions.
"Modern science invests old topics wit new interest. The fundamental factors o sanitation are now so well understood tha the question of climate and its influence upo health and disease may be discussed wit the assurance of dealing somewhat, at least,
with objective factors, instead of theory an the results of experience alone. Every stu-
dent of modern medicine finds a new inspi-

ration from the great progress already mad by the indefatigable labors of a considerabl number of trained workers in all the leadin countries. The one object of research ha been to ascertain the causes of communica-
ble diseases.
"The so-called 'germ theory of disease'
passed from the realm of theory into that o demonstration as fact, and based upon ou present knowledge, confessedly fragmentar and imperfect, yet sufficiently exact fro which to make deductions, sanitation ha become in a large measure a science. Fro this standpoint, climatology is invested wit a new interest and value, as seen especiall in the contributions of the last few years.
A surgically clean wound means an asepti wound. The aphorism of Hippocrates,
'pure air, pure water, pure soil,' signifie now an air, water and soil free from infec-
tious elements of disease, and this must b defined as the most important factor per-
taining to a health resort, sought under th name of climate."
The Virtue of Sanitary Science Much attention of late has been given to coun-
try residences, both by sanitarians aud the trade allied in interest in house construction. Very ex-
tensive observations have been made by Dr. Lucy
M. Hall, who recently delivered a lecture befor the Academy of Anthropology in New York on
"Sanitation in the Country." She has examine over one hundred and fifty country houses in the
East and in the West, aud gives it as her opinio that the country house is not the healthful plac it is usually supposed to be. She has robbe country life of much of the charm with whic people in crowded cities have robed it. A vacatio in the country, according to her opinion, is no assured of the promises of health with which man bent on a summer outing regard it. She has foun disease and death lurking in the vine-clad cottag and in the cool retreats of the shaded dwelling This state of affairs is produced by the ignoranc of hygienic laws and their violation. Among th evils found to exist are improper drainage, uuce-
meuted cellars, failure to ventilate sleeping apart-
ments, exclusive of light, too much shade abou the house, and the improper disposal of kitche refuse It is probably not saying too much to state tha a majority of country houses owe their escap from more continuous and fatal sickness to th free circulation of the air, the cleansing effects o rains, frost and other natural agents, more tha to any regard for sanitary laws. Were the averag of country homes crowded together, and shut ou from the free action of these agents, as in  crowded city, their sanitary condition would be-
come deplorable. Nature abhors disease, and i many ways attempts to remedy tho evils cause by man in the violation of her laws. But th transgressor can go too far. He can trespass to rudely upon her broad benefactions; can weake the hand that extends to him benedictions, an must suffer. Her laws violated and her strengt impaired, artificial means must be resorted to i order to supply the loss. Herein we see the stride made by sanitation; herein we see the lack of i in the country home nestling upon the broa bosom of earth, where nature, uncontaminated,
would be sweet and pure. Man not only pollute nature and weakens her forces, but, through hi indifference and ignorance, makes a habitatio possible only for disease, and bequeaths to pos-
terity a legacy of constitutional ills The report of Dr. Hall does not stop with point-
ing out these evils that a remedy may follow, but,
if only half true, it emphasizes, in a very direc manner, the value of sanitary science as related t the home. Had the science not stepped to th rescue, our crowded cities would have been sufler-
ing from the ills that afflict the country house,
aggravated by almost limitless accumulations We are apt to look upou the architect, engineer,
builder and plumber as so many people engage in solving for themselves the problem of brea and butter, and not as so many agents assisting-
nature in the preservation of life and health. W invito the physician to heal our ills, and shut th door to that science which prevents disease. W rightly' esteem the health officer whose diligenc procures us pure water, but too lightly regard th responsibility resting on the plumber who safel conducts that water polluted by use from ou dwellings Sanitary science has not only made great ad-
vancement, but it has to a marked degree educate maukiud up to a recognition and appreciation o its virtues. Its claims are so well established an accepted that a disregard of its teachings and law can bo considered but little less than a willful ac of criminality.—Sanitary News Diphtheria Contagions The laity must recognize the unanimous an loudly-proclaimed verdict of the medical profes-
sion that at all times and in all cases diphtheria i contagious, and yield a common-sense acquies-
cence in the necessities which impose the isolatio and quarantine of those stricken with the disease Further, they should also refrain from secretin from the disinfecting officers garments aud ma-
terial lately in immediate use about the patient,
and consequently most certainly infected On the medical attendant rests the imperativ duty of inculcating into the minds of the doubtfu the full danger of intercourse, the necessity o proper application of disinfectants to the ejecta,
to tho utensils and other material about the sick,
and also to direct proper inquiry into the sanitar condition of the premises, with suggestions lor th rectilic-ation of apparently existing evils To the sanitary authorities belong the responsi-
bilities of legal correction of illegal violation o sanitary ordinances, the best protection of th neighbors from actual dangers, and the thoroug application of the most certain known disinfect-
ants to infected material compatible with safet to life and property The complete performance of every det ail of thi tripartite duty would surely rapidly diminish th danger, if not entirely remove it. Unfortunately

each of the three factors is wanting in that thor-
oughness of application absolutely essential t success. The laity will readily admit that from  bad case of diphtheria others may follow, but in-
variably the lighter forms of the disease are con-
sidered barren of the dangerous quality of conta-
gion, and even a recognition of the danger will no always deter the curious from braving it, generall to the peril, unfortunately, of an innocent thir party. Concealment of articles lately in the in-
fected room from the disinfecting corps, thus in-
validating any great good which might result fro their work, is another most pernicious practice o the part of the people. In two instances wher this occurred—in one from a shawl and anothe from a blanket secreted—to the children envelope in them diphtheria soon followed in a fatal form Isolation of the sick from other members of th same family, instructions for proper disinfection o material in immediate proximity, and prompt re-
port of the case to the sanitary authorities, tha designative marks may be placed on the house t caution those willing and glad to remain awa from infection, appertain to the duty of the attend-
ing physician. To the credit of a few of our phy-
sicians, some perform this duty well.—New Orleans

"Tho mean barometric for the month has bee somewhat below the normal, while the mean tem-
perature was lowest with the exception of 1882
and 1885, recorded during the past eighteen years The last few day s in the month reduced the tempera-
ture to 26° below the normal. Tbe total rainfal for the month was 5.00 inches, 4.50 of which fel after the 24th. The heaviest rain occurred on the

p. m. both suddenly disappeared. No cold wav signals ordered during the month."
Sergt. L. M. Pindell. U. S. Observer at Chat-
tanooga, makes the following notes:
"The continuous dry spell has proven disas-
trous to crops. The strawberry crops were seriousl damaged; turnips nearly burnt up; potatoes ver small and inferior, the crop being very poor; in fac little or no gardening produce has been successfull raised. Producers on the Ridge, and on east bas of Lookout Mountain, claim that unless rain,
and a plenty of it occurs soon, their entire crop will be ruined, and in consequence, the loss heavy Prom 2.37 a. in. to 9.35 a in. the 30th, 2.55 inche of rain fell. The fall of rain was so great between
3.38 a. m. and 6.40 a. in. that streets and lowland were flooded; streets never known to be floode before, w ere covered in some places from one inc to twenty-threo inches in depth, caused by th sewers not being able to carry off the heavy vol-
ume of water; following this heavy rainfall, was  cold wave. The temperature began to fall Htll.12
a. ui. of the 30th, and at 8 p. m. a fall of 18° wh recorded. The temperature fell rapidly in th afternoon; from 6 p. m. to 8 p. in., a fall of8C.2

ing wind, northwest The observer at Kiddieton makes the followin notes of thunderstorms during the month: "Th thunder and hail storm of the 20th did considerabl damage to fencing and fruit trees, and in washin plowed ground very badly. It was reported to b much more severe in the western and southwester portions of tho county. The rain was mixed wit nail, which packed the plowed ground very hard The hard gusts of winds blew down numbers o trees in this locality. The storm began at 5.50 p.
m. and ended at 7 p. m. Another severe stor was that of the 25th, which began at 2 p. ni. an ended at 5 p. m. ; it came from west southwes with hail also; tho wind was very high and ble down several trees and fences. The hard winds i both these storms lasted but a few minutes, there-
fore no high hourly velocities were recorded. The
Btorm of the 30th was a marked ono on account o the excessive rainfall which followed, 1.26 inc falling in three hours."
The observer at Nunnelly furnishes tho follow-
ing notes on the rain of the 25th: At 9 a. m. the-
wind began blowing in squalls from the southwest,
increasing in volume until 12.15, when smal clouds began rising southwest, which increased i area until noon, 'when dark masses of clouds be-
gan to form from west to north, moving eastward,
with occasional distant thunder. The cloud bega to extend westward and to assume a very dar and threatening appearance. Soudding clouds,
began to form on the upper border of the nimbus,
of a yellowish hue, and move swiftly southeast-
ward. 'When they reached the zenith it becam as dark as twilight, and the rain began falling i torrents. The wind suddenly vecrod to northwest,,
and blew at about 40 miles per hour for 30 sec-

P. Hadden, Daniel F. Wright, James M Safford and P. D. Sims. Absent: E. W Cole and G. B. Thornton Upon motion the minutes of the previou meeting, as published in the Bulletin for

port:
Office State Board of Health,'
Nashville, July 2, 1889 Dr. J. D. Plunket, President State Board of Health:
Sir—Just five years ago your Board did me th honor to elect me to the position of Secretary At that very meeting the first telegraphic new was read announcing the unexpected and violen outbreak of cholera in its most virulent form i a Mediterranean port of France This announcement caused great alarm through-
out Europe, and no small amount of uneasiness in
America, specially in our own interior valley fro the Dominion to the Gulf of Mexico During 1885 and 1886 portions of Italy and
Spain were scourged, and also a few points in
South America However, contrary to all previous history, th plague did not spead over Europe, nor did it visi the United States This fact attracted, of course, very wide notice,
and everywhere an explanation was demanded Only one solution cciild be found. Whereas,
in 1832, 1849, 1866, 1873, this disease was allowe to take it? own course, no effort in most case whatever being made to prevent its entrance, o this occasion exactly the opposite plan was pur-
sued.
A few years back the entire machinery of stat preventive medicine Was unknown. In 1884 most/
European and American governments maintaine national, state and city boards of health, mor or less efficiently. Hence and hence alone th difference. Those portion^, of Southern Europ were ravaged where scientific sanitation was no only neglected but really unknown. Its sprea from these regions where it caused untold misery,
terror and mortality during three years into th rest of Europe was prevented by prompt, scientifi and humane quarantine measures relating to com-
munities, and by rigid isolation and disinfection o of individual cases occurring outside of infecte districts It got into Brazil and Chili because of gros violation of sanitary axioms. It avoided the
United States because of the strict observance o those axioms As a consequence the value and merit of board of health, and of sanitary regulations faithfull carried out, have been greatly enhanced in publi estimation. The grand lesson has been learne that epidemics do not move with irresitible fury This is a great gain, of inestimable value to th public peace, comfort and safety. I know that

this is so in Tennessee, for previously to this las splendid demonstration of sanitary progress th words Asiatic cholera always evoked images o desolation and dismay in the minds of the thou-
sands who had gone through the experience o the four previous epidemics Since 1884 the experience with small-pox an yellow fever has also taught our people the grea lesson that epidemic diseases need not prevail;
and that their very prevalence is proof conclusiv of gross and culpable neglect on the part of ruler somewhere This lesson will not be lost. Typhoid fever,
diphtheria and scarlet fever will soon be in th category of diseases which should be prevented Each case will be minutely studied, its origin as-
certained and its causation of other cases ob-
structed by thorough isolation and disinfection In all this line of work progress is the rule in
Tennessee, noticeable at all events, though not s rapid and satisfactory as in those of our sister
States which have furnished full equipment fo work to their sanitary officials Looking at the very slender means placed by th wealthy and populous State of Tennessee at th disposal of its board of health, I cannot avoid th conviction that wit hin the past five years a remark-
able work has been accomplished by it. A mont ago I had a growling report in composition becaus of dwelling upon the manifold deficiencies in ou large cities and beautiful villages. But returnin from an inspection of some of the oldest an wealthiest portions of the Union, I am rather as-
tonished that Tennessee is so wide-awake as it i to-day. Like progress in another five years wil place it in an advanced position, of which all Ten-
nesseans may justly be proud Just four years ago, the board, after mature de-
liberation, decided to devote about one-third of it small annual appropriation to the publication an distribution of a monthly Bulletin so as to reac every locality of and every interest in the State This plan has been carefully and systematicall worked out. Some months 5.000 copies hav been circulated; in no month less than 2.000 These go regularly to all persons who pay th small subscription of twenty-five cents annually,
to all newspapers and other periodicals in Tennes-
see, to a large exchange list outside the State an to special lists at home and abroad as occasio may demand. Nothing is sent out from the offic of this board, helter-skelter. In all cases record are kept, so that we know whether or not labo and money is wasted Thus far the value of this publication is demon-
strated. At least seven other States have followe our example. v Exchanges from every part of Ten-
nessee and from all portions of the Union give u valuable sources of information, and enable us t make Tennessee well and favorably known as a
State eminently adapted to the best class of immi-
grants from the malarial South or the arctic
North The Bulletin has awakened much interest i many localities for better sanitation. Thus a foun-
dation for rapid and enduring practical work ha been laid by you, which will enable the board t make great progress in its highest and most endur-
ing lines right away. And here much is to be done Nashville and Memphis, through their municipa authorities, do not sufficiently back their healt officers, Chattanooga is asleep, Knoxville is awa behind the times, our smaller cities and towns al need more efficient sanitation The cheering fajt, however, prevails, that th people are ahead of their rulers and will soon re-
place them by more faithful servants The following additions have been made to th library duriug the quarter:

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Sims be appointed a delegate to the National
Prison Association, to be held in Nashville The term of Dr. Wright having expire he was, upon motion of Dr. Sims, unani-
mously recommended to the Governor fo reappointment After examination of accounts and ap-
proval of the same, the Board adjourned t meet on Tuesday, October ist An Opportunity Elsewhere in this issue we reproduce a editorial and open letter from Robert P Porter, Superintendent of Census, to th medical profession, which we extract from
The Drugman. No copy of this letter wa received by fhe State Board of HealrVi The subject—vital statistics—is one whic this Board has been deeply interested i since its organization, but which tip to no they have failed in inducing the Legislatur to adopt for the State a permanent syste regarding. Here is an opportunity, how-
ever, to do the next best thing, and w would therefore, urge every county an municipal health officer to interest himsel in this matter, and at once, dhd by timel agitations of the subject-*-through the loca press and otherwise—arouse the practition-
ers of medicine in their respective district to the full appreciation of the opportunit thus offered, and the importance of eac one doing what he can to make the re-
turns asked for as full and accurate as possi-
ble. The single fact, that we have np Stat law in Tennessee upon vital statistics, shoul be reason enough, that this effort, both as i pertains to the medical profession in the
State, as weil as to the census officials, shoul be more than ordinarily thorough; and i that connection we would call attention t the fact, that the "Physician's Registers"
which Mr. Porter in his letter proposed t send out during the month of May last t the medical profession, have not, sb far a we have information, been received in Ten-
nessee up to this writing. This omissio should be promptly supplied Regions in West Tennessee of Sulphur Water and Chalybeate Waters, Respectively—The Lin of Division Between the Two Regions—The Ori-
gin of Iron Ore By J. M. SAFFORD, Ph. D. Chairman of Committee on Water Supply In considering the wells, springs and streams o the western division of the State as to the charac-
ter of the waters they supply, we must at the out-
set recognize the fact that West Tennessee i divided into two very unequal portions by a re-
markable line running north and south, known as
"The Old Shore Line." To the east of this ar hard rocks, limestones, shales and flinty layers,
such as belong to Middle Tennessee, and of whic indeed they are the extreme western extension an terminus; while to the west, spreading over a.
great area, are beds of little indurated sands an clays. This line, or ancient shore, for such it is,
lies in general a little to the west of the Tennesse river, the two being approximately parallel. No-
where does it coincide with the bed of the Ten-
nessee, excepting for a diftance of about eightee miles in Hardin county. Along this portion of th fiver are Pittsburg landing, Savannah and Coffe landing. Passing the latter landing and going-
northward, the Old Shore and the river no longe coincide. The Old Shore passes just west of I)e-
caturville, in Decatur county, and of Camden and
Big Sandy station, in Benton. These places may,
in fact, be considered as located on the Shore From Big Sandy station it bends more to the east,
approaching, in Henry county, within two mile of the Mouth of Sandy and Paris landings. Thenc its direction is parallel with the river to the Ken-
tucky boundary If we compare the formations of the two por-
tions of country separated by this Old Shore Line,
including their respective concomitants, rocks,
minerals, soils, etc., the contrasts are seen to b very marked. "We have here to do with the wa-
ters. On the east, from the limestone and shales,
the springs are " sulphur," or have limestone hard-
ness; on the west they are chalybeate, or else sof and freestone. Such is the jule. There are excep-
tions, as might be expected. The exceptions o the west arise from the occurrence of two specia formations—earthy strata, rich in limy matter,
the waters of which will be considered below What is true of springs is true of wells and o the smaller streams. Some of the larger stream in the matter of water follow the rule; others,
draining areas lying on both sides of the Shor line, supply water of mised or modified character.

to illustrate the differences referred to. East o the Shore line, and out of limestones chiefly, th following sulphur waters may be mentioned:
The •'Bed Sulphur" and the " White Sulphur"
of Hardin county, two distinct but neighborin springs, near the Tennessee river, on its wester side, and but little north of the Mississippi line The sites of both of these were improved befor the war and were pleasant, popular places The "Artesian Well" of the northern part of
Hardiu county, originally bored for salt water, an located at a point half a mile north of White Oak
Tiver, and about a mile aud a half west of the
Tennessee. A large stream of water issues wit considerable force from this well.
"Bath Springs," in the southern part of Decatu county, is another point well known for its sulphu water. It was once a place of resort, is abou seven miles northwest from Clifton, on the roa leading from Lexington and Jackson The noted "Artesian Well" of Henry county,
near the bottom of the Big Sandy river, and nin miles from its mouth. This, like the artesian wel of fl ardin, was bored for salt water, the boring i both cases being several hundred feet in limeston rock. The boring in the Henry well is some 400
feet deep, and yields a great flow of water—enoug to turn a small mill. This has been a place o great resort, and is now to a limited extent. Bot this and the artesian well of Hardin are temporarily
■covered with back-water from the Tennessee, whe the latter is in flood It would be easy to multiply examples. I d not hesitate to designate the portion of West Ten-
nessee east of the Old Shore as the sulphur wate belt Passing to the west of the Old Shore, sulphu water disappears, and chalybeate takes its place In contrast with what has been given, the follow-
ing springs and wells, a few taken from many, are
•enumerated. The range of those selected is no far west of the dividing Shore liuo.
"The Dunlaj) Chalybeate Springs," about tw and a half miles south of Bolivar. These suppl abundant water, are located in a grove of hug forest trees, in a cool valley or cove, surrounde by hills, all making a retreat of most attractive
■character, well frequented by the good people of
Bolivar and their friends, ailing or not.
"Bethel Springs," a station on the Mobile <fc
■Ohio railroad, in McNairy county. A spring sup-
plies a free flow of delightful chalybeate that lon before the railroad was thought of was resorted t by invalids and others for its curative powers.
"Mason's Wells," in Madison county. A group
■of three wells, oue a bored well, with improve-
ments, located at a poiut eleven miles from Jack-
son, on the Jackson and Jack's Creek road, als about three miles, air-line, north of northwest from
Pinsou, a station on the Mobile <fc Ohio railroad,
and one mile from the Chester county line. The
"wolls" have long been famous for their medica virtues, and are a Mecca for those of the surround-
ing regions burdened with ills, fancied or real Tho principal well is 70 feet deep, with 30 feet o water, which is very moderately chalybeate an slightly astringent. The water reminds one o that of the Gibson Wells, which hold a high plac in public favor The Chalybeates of Carroll county, around Hunt-
ingdon. These are in profusion, there being man of them in the bottom near the town. Some hav formed low mounds of ferric oxide or ooze aroun them, in which a small unwary animal migh easily mire and be lost. The people of Hunting-
don enjoy them, and here and there one, in th cool shade of the great trees of the bottom, is th centre of a delightful picnic and dancing ground.
A short distance south of the town is an artesia chalybeate, from the pipe of which is a great flo of clear, sparkling and refreshing water. A hote was built here some years ago for the reception o summer visitors, but for some reason it proved  failure—certainly not for lack of mineral water o choice character and in abundance Chalybeate in Henry county. A few miles eas of Paris, in low, swampy ground, through whic the Louisville & Memphis railroad runs, are sev-
eral chalybeate springs, supplying good cool wa-
ter. At one of these, very near the track, a trai will sometimes, in a hot summer day, stop for  supply, much to the gratification of the hot, thirst passengers. More removed from the track of th road, but in the same region, is a noted spring,
free flowing and highly palatable. From Paris t this spring is a favorite drive and often made The chalybeates here given may be considere typical of the waters of tho springs and wells i the portion of West Tennessee west of the shor line. This portion is the region of chalybeat water It would be interesting to discuss the genesis,
on the one hand, of the eastern sulphur water,
and, on the other, that of the western chalybeates This we may do hereafter, and only remark her as to the latter that the presence of changin organic vegetable matter iu the soft rocks, thos west of the Shore, aud of comparatively recen origin, has determined the character of the water The decomposing matter has deoxidized the highe oxide of iron, converting it into the lower oxide,
and has at the same time supplied the acid (car-
bonic) to convert this lower oxide into iron car-
bonate. As a second step, the water, charged

■with an excess of carbonic acid, has dissolved thi iron carbonate, thereby making itself chalybeate.
"We might go on and slate that so soon as th chalybeate water comes to the free air, the proces above is in a measure reversed; the water loses it excess of carbonic acid; the carbonate is precipi-
tated and decomposed, and the lower oxide o iron oxidized into the higher. In this way, throug the action of organic matter and water, the iro oxide widely diffused through the sands and clay is taken up, made soluble, then deposited as oxid ooze about the mouths of tho springs, to becom in the end, indeed, hard iron ore. Many of ou iron ore beds, where now no chalybeate water i found, have been formed in just such a way Glanders in Gibson County Under date of June 28, 1889, Dr. T. J Happel, County Health Officer of Gibson
County, made the following report to the
County Court:
"I would respectfully present the following re-
port in regard to the existence of glanders amon the stock in the fourth and fifth districts of you county:
•'As reported to you at tho April term of th court, the existence of glanders among the horse and mules of Joe Watt, of the fourth district,
was rumored. You saw fit, as a County Court, t take no official action in regard to the matter fur-
ther than to advise quarantining, etc. Early in
June the existence of the disease became noto-
rious, and about the middle of the month Dr Ford, a veterinary surgeon from Jackson, whils in this county, examined Mr. Watt's stock an reported two undoubted cases in mules on hi place. This fact, through the livery interests of
Humboldt and Jackson, was reported to the Gov-
ernor and State Board of Health, as well as t myself. The State Board of Health at once ad-
dressed a letter to the County Board of Health of
Gibson County, urging prompt action to destro said stock and disinfect stables, etc.
"On the 18th of June, whilst in Nashville o business, 1 called on the President of the State
Board of Health and discussed the situation wit him.
"All cases of glanders that have occurred i these districts named have been directly or indi-
rectly traced to one common origin. There ar said to bo other cases of the disease yet existin in the neighborhood, but when it is "known tha such diseased stock is to be killed, it will soon b difficult to find them all. One other case ha already been reported to me, but as yet I hav had no time to investigate it. On the 23d ult. I
visited and examined Mr. Watt's stock, consistin of two mules and one horse. He had had thro mules, but about a week before my visit one of th diseased mules had become so decrepit and offen-
sive that he had it killed and thrown into a ditch An examination of the stock showed one mule,
which had been quarantined from the others, wit a well marked case of the glanders, just enterin the last stage of the disease. I made arrange-
ments and had that mule killed, with tho consen of Mr. Watt, the next day at the same place wher the carcass of the other mule lay, and had bot animals burned. A bill for the killing and burnin is on your table to-day. The horse owned by Mr Watt showed not a trace of the disease, and th remaining mule showed but one enlarged glan that could excite any suspicion. Mr. Watt wa notified to tear down and burn the old stable i which the diseased mules had at times been kept,
and to disinfect, lime, clean, etc., his new stable The new stable has been attended to, but up to
Friday the old one had not been removed. A the County Board of Health had heretofore passe no rules concerning such matters when the cas arose, it would possibly be proper to compensate
Mr. Watt for the stable, or at least to pay fo pulling down and burning.
"AU cases of diseases of a contagious natur among stock should be promptly reported to the
County Board of Health, so that they could b looked after promptly."
In letter dated July 3d and received from
Dr. Happel, he says:
"In report 1 made to the County Court, a con of which was forwarded you, you will see I lai the facts regarding the existence of glanders in
Gibson County fully before them. I also read t the court the rules about glanders adopted, a cop of which appears below, and in a short talk to th court 1 attempted to impress the importance o eradicating at once the disease, and asked them t adopt as their own the rules. I advised the pay-
ment of half value for the stock destroyed. Al these things the court did, so that, thus far. ther is no trouble. I hope before the October term o the court to root out all cases of the disease i the county."
"At a meeting of the County Board of Healt of Gibson County, held this day in Trenton,
Tenn., the following rules and regulations wer adopted:
'• 1. Tt shall be unlawful fur any one knowingl to keep any stock affected with glanders. An one violating this rule shall be arrested by an officer, under a warrant sworn out by any citize of Gibson county, carried before any convenien magistrate, and upon conviction fined from $2.50
to $10.00 for each and every offense.
'• 2. It shall be the duty of any party or partie owning any stock having glanders, when notifie by the County Board of Health, at once to kill o cause to be killed said stock and to bum their dea bodies, or bury them to the depth of at least si feet in the ground, covering them with uuslacke lime before covering them with dirt. Any viola-
tion of this rule shall be punishable as in Rule 1,
by a fine of $5.00 to $10.00, and a separate arres may be made for every day said stock is allowe to live, after notice to destroy has been served.
"3. It shall be the duty of any party or partie owning stock that have been exposed to glander to keep them quarantined from other stock, an under no circumstances to allow them to run a large until six months shall have elapsed from th time of exposure to said disease. Any violatio of this rule shall be punished, as in section 1, by  fiue of $2.50 for each and every offense.

Vital Statistics in the Next Census The newly appointed Superintendent of the
Census, Robert P. Porter, has already begun th preliminary work of inakiug, if possible, the cen-
sus of 1890, in respect to accuracy aud fullness,
■without a parallel in this country. To be success-
ful in this great undertaking, it will bo necessar that all shall help. Below we reprint a circula letter from him, addressed to the medical profes-
sion in the United States, which explains itself Naturally vital statistics are given preference i being thus lirst considered, as in their applicatio they possess a direct personal value to the people,
which is more immediate and far-reaching in im-
portance. Notwithstanding this fact, vital statis-
tics in this country have uniformly in the pas been, by long odds, the most difficult to obtain,
and Id each successive effort of the Government i this direction, this subdivision of the census stand out conspicuous in its incompleteness The want of uniformity of legislation in those
States of the Onion which have systems of vita statistics, and the entire want of legislation upo the subject in other States—as, for instance, in
Tennessee—give to such statistics in Americ naturally but little scientific value, and, as a con-
sequence, the subject becomes to us as a people  standing reproach by all the more enlightene nations of the world. Now, it is to correct thi state of affairs, as far as under our system of gov-
ernment a national census can do so, that Mr Porter in his circular lettnr earnestly solicits th individual and collective aid of that professio which, more than any other, has cognizauce of th matter of births and deaths We sincerely hope the medical profession of th country will extend to the full the assistanc asked, and with proper enthusiasm will enter a once upon the work as thus outlined by the Super-
intendent of Census of 1890.—The Druijman Department ok the Interior,
Census Office, Washington, May 1, 1889 To the Medical Profession:
The various medical associations and the medi-
cal profession will be glad to learn that Dr. John
S. Billings, Surgeon IT. S. Army, has consented t take charge of the Report on the Mortality and
Tital Statistics of the United States as returne by the eleventh census Ah the United States has no system of registra-
tion of vital statistics, such as is relied upon b other civilized nations for the purpose of ascertain-
ing the actual movement of population, our censu affords tho only opportunity of obtaining near a approximate estimate of the birth and death rate of much tho larger part of the country, which i entirely unprovided with any satisfactory syste of State and municipal registration In view of this, the census office during th month of May this year will issue to the medica profession throughout the country "Physician's
Registers," for the purpose of obtaining more accu-
rate returns of deaths than it is possible for th enumerators to make. It is earnestly hoped tha physicians in every part of the country will aid th census olfiee in this important work. The recor should be kept from Juue 1, 1889, to May 31, 1890 Xearly 26,000 of these registration blanks wer filled up and returned to the office in 1880, an nearly all of them used for statistical purposes It is hoped that double this number will be ob-
tained for the eleventh census Physicians not receiving registers can obtai them by sending their names aud addresses to th census office, aud, with tho register, an officia envelope which requires no stamp will be provide for their return to Washington If all medical and surgical practitioners through-
out the country will lend their aid, the mortalit and vital statistics of the eleventh ceusus will b more comprehensive and complete than they hav ever been. Every physician should take a per-
sonal pride iu having this report as full and accu-
rate as it is possible to make it It is hereby promised that all information ob-
tained through this source shall be held strictl confidential. Rouert P. Porter,
Superintendent of Census.
A New Deodorant Bromine has lor a long time been recognized a being valuable in the treatment of gangrene an foul-smelling ulcers, but uutil recently its merit as an effectual and cheap deodorant have not bee appreciated. It was brought into prominence  few months ago by Mr. Martin, the chemist o the health department of this city, who suggeste its use upon the earth thrown up in laying th electric subways. As it is a by-product obtaine in the manufacture of salt, and is not used exten-
sively in the arts, it is sold at a very reasonabl price—about seventy cents per pound. It ha the property of precipitating the hydrocarbons o illuminating gas, and thus can be used to deodoriz the earth exposed in excavations in the vicinity o gas-mains. More valuable than this is its effec upon decomposing organic bodies, which it ren-
ders completely inoffensive. This property ren-
ders it particularly valuable for use in stables,
privy vaults, urinals, cess-pools, or in any plac which may contain foul-smelling organic matters It is soluble iu about thirty-three parts of water,
but a solution of this strength is not advisable, a there is a constant escape from it of the vapor o bromine, which is very irritating to the eyes an air-passages, and which may even attack woo and metals. For ordinary purposes it is used i solutions containing one part by weight to abou eight hundred of water. In this strength it ma be used freely without its affecting anything whic it may touch. A fn\v gallons used daily will re-
move all amoniacal odors from stables, or a fe quarts will thoroughly deodorize the entire plumb-
ing system of an ordinary house. It also might

be used with advantage upon ordinary hous garbage, which usually becomes offensive so speed-
ily in warm weather. There would appear to b scarcely any limit to its usefulness in this branc of sanitary science, and it will, as its merits ar better known, undoubtedly be adopted universall as a substitute for the deodorants now in use,
which usually act by substituting one unpleasan odor for another. The only drawback in its us lies in the fact that the undiluted bromine i strongly corrosive, and if it touches the ski causes a painful burn. Where it is used in larg quantities this can be obviated by opening th bottle, or, what is simpler, breaking it unde water. As its use becomes more extended it wil undoubtedly be put up in pearls or tubes contain-
ing only as much as would be needed at one tim in the average household.—N. Med. Jour Sir Bdwin Chadwick, in an address on sanitar science, says: "Physicians are beginning to de-
clare that a large amount of the crime for whic punishment is inflicted is due to insanity, and tha insanity is due to low physical condition whic sanitation by early physical training would re-
move. Thore are experiences to show that this i the fact. Dr. Ashe and others conversant wit the lunatic asylum declare that, as a class, luna-
tics are of low physical condition, and that lo condition is reducible by sanitation and earl physical training. Of thirty thousand blind per-
sons, the late Dr. Rolph declared that two-third might have been saved by early sanitation."
A Safe Cordial It is true that milk heated to much above 100
degrees Fahrenheit loses for a time, in a slight de-
gree, its sweetness and density But no one who, fatigued by over-exertion o body and mind, has ever experienced the rovivin influence of a tumbler of this beverage, heated a warm as it can be sipped, and with or without  teaspoonful of sugar, will willingly forego a resor to it because of its being rendered somewhat les acceptable to the palate The promptness with which its cordial influenc is felt is indeed surprising. Some portion of i seems to be digested and appropriated almost im-
mediately, aud many who now fancy they nee alcoholic stimulants when exhausted by fatigu will find iu this simple draught an equivalent tha will be abundantly satisfying, and far more endur-
ing in its effects. There is many an ignorant,
over-worked woman who faucies she could no keep up without her beer. She mistakes th momentary exhilaration for strength, aud applie the whip instead of nourishment to her poor, ex-
hausted frame. Any honest, intelligent physicia will tell her that there is more real strength an nourishment in a slice of bread than iu a (mart o beer; but if she loves stimulants it would he  very useless piece of information. It is claime that some of the lady clerks in our own city, an these, too, who are employed in respectable busi-
ness houses, have been in the habit of ordering al or beer from the restaurants. They probably clai that they are "tired"—aud no one who sees thei faithful devotion to customers all day will doub their assertions. But they should not mistak beer for a blessiug, or stimulus for strength. A
careful examination of statistics will prove tha men and women who do not drink can endur more hardships, and do more work, aud live longer,
than those less temperate.—Bulletin R. I. State
Board of Health Inebriate Asylums Dr. T. D. Crothers, of Eartford, Conn., in a address on " Inebriate Asylums and Their Work."
delivered at Toronto, Can., draws the followin conclusions as being supported by the latest teach-
ings of science and experience: 1. Inebriate hos-
pitals must take the place id'jails and station-
houses. Such places are dangerous in their menta and physical surroundings, by intensifying the de-
generation, and removing the patient beyond hop of recovery. They are in many cases litera training-stations for mustering iu armies of chroni maniacs that never desert or leave the ranks unti crushed out forever. 2. Inebriate hospitals shoul receive the incurable inebriates, and make the self-supporting, and build them up physically an mentally. They would relieve the tax-payer, an relieve society of untold burdens of sorrow an misery. 3. Inebriate hospitals should receive th recent cases, and place them iu the highest condi-
tions of enforced health and vigor, and thus retur a large number to health and sobriety again. 4 Inebriate hospitals can and should be self-support ing when once established. They should be man-
aged on scientific business principles, like militar training-schools. 5. Inebriate hospitals should b built from the money raised by taxes on the sal of spirits, on the priuciple that every busines should be obliged to provide for the accident which grow out of it. 6. These are the realitie which every inebriate hospital is approaching, an which all experience points out as practical an literal in the near future. 7. The inebriate hos-
pitals of to-day are only in the infancy of thei work, contending with great opposition and preju-
dice, misunderstood, condemned, and workin against innumerable obstacles. 8. The work o the present inebriate hospitals, notwithstandin all the difficulties and imperfections, has the grand-
est promise for the future, aud encouragement fo further effort in this field, along the line of scien-
tific research. 9. Lastly, there is an intense per-
sonality in inebriate hospitals to each one of us They may bring salvation and restoration to som one near and dear. Tbey may be fountains o healing whose influence shall cross and influenc our pathway iu many ways. 10. Inebriate hos-
pitals and their work are the great new land whic only a few settlors have reached. They are call-
ing to us to come up aud occupy, and thus hel the race on in the great march from the lower t the higher.—Science Cremation Des Moines, la., has a crematory for the cit refuse which cost only $1,700.

Microbic Longevity To the literature of this subject I venture th following contribution:
Thirty-five years ago an opulent family lived i a palatial home in one of our most beautiful sub-
urbs. Two lovely children graced the happ household. liut scarlet fever, that fell foe o childhood, closed their eyes in death. The grief-
stricken mother gathered up little slips, slippers
.and toys with two golden tresses, and reverentl laid them away in a trunk as sad but priceles mementoes of her lost darlings War came with its tragic vicissitudes, and deat time and again threw its shadow over the hearth-
stone Finally the place passed into stranger hands Last year two families took it as a summer resi-
dence The children, six in number, with childish curi-
osity, begau to explore the secret recesses of th grand old house. In a closet was found the for-
gotten trunk. A touch dissolved the time-corrode clasp, and one by one the sacred relics were re-
moved, until a faded newspaper was found, whic told the pathetic story. Half spelling out th meaning, they took it to their mother, who chrde their curiosity, and tenderly replaced the treas-
ures Five days after this occurrence two of .the chil-
dren were seized with scarlet fever, and forty-
eight hours later the other four were attacked Two cases were grave, the others mild. All re-
covered Was the disease contracted from the trunk? I
think so, because there was no other ascertainabl source of infection Moral: Silks, woolen and hair, being good fomi-
ties, should not be put away in air-tight trunks a mementoes of friends dying with infectious dis-
eases, because they may become, at some remot period, the starting point of a wide-spreading an disastrous epidemio, a calamity which was averte in this instance only by complete isolation.—T. A Atchison, M. D Electric Lights Indoors Theoretically there is a great advantage in close rooms in using electric light instead of gas light,
and practically it has been found in the Postomce
Central Savings Bank in London, that during th past two years, since the introduction of the elec-
trio lights into the building, there has been  marked decrease in the amount of time lost fro sickness by the clerks and employees. They ge rid of the undesirable products of combustio which accompany the use of gas lights, and the therefore have a pure air to breathe.—The Sanitary

A comely and comfortable condition of the street of a town impress all whose impressions are wort anything mightily in favor of the thrift of the in-
habitants. Good streets are in the nature of  first-class advertisement of a town. On the othe hand, ragged, unkept streets are a sign of deteri-
oration, or a betrayal of poverty that has neve been taken plate of by something better. Loo to your streets and your fences, and thus mak sure of the good opinion of strangers who com within the gates of the city.—Dayton News Florida Board of Health Northern owners of real estate in Florida ex-
press much gratification over the creation of a
State Hoard of Health for that State. The boar is well equipped, with almost unlimited powers,
and an ample appropriation. Had such a hoar been created two years ago, Jacksonville woul not have suffered as she did last year from yello fever. Florida has long been in need of an abl and vigilant State Board of Health.—Sanitary
Volunteer Results of Vaccination The opponents of vaccination in England hav of late been more active than ever; and, as a re-
sult of their activity, a royal commissioner ha been appointed, whose duty it shall be to make  full investigation of the whole subject, and snb-
mit a report theieon. Friends of vaccinatio should welcome such an inquiry, as the metho stands upon such a firm foundation of facts as t be able to stand the most searching examination If it has not accomplished all that is claimed fo it, the failure is due to insufficient or inefficien performance of the operation, and the sooner suc abuse of it is made public the better. It is  rather remarkable coincidence that just at thi time events should transpire at Sheffield, England,
which show the value of vaccination. Small-po has recently been very prevalent in that city. I a population of about 320,000 there have been
6,088 cases of tho disease, of which number 590
proved fatal. Dr. Barry, who has made a repor to the local government board, finds that the at-
tack-rate of the vaccinated children under ten wa five in a thousand; of the unvaccinated of th same age, 101 in a thousand. The death rates fo the same classes were respectively .09 and 44. I every hundred thousand of those twice vaccinate there were eight deaths; once vaccinated, 100
deaths; and unvaccinated, 5,100 deaths.—Science To Detect Lead in Water Place two perfectly bright and clean knitting-

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH BULLETIN Ice Water There is a great deal of sentiment and man opinions regarding the use of ice water that vanis when the light of reason and experience is turne upon them. The fact is, that ice water, dran slowly and in moderate quantities, constitutes  healthful and invigorating drink. There is n doubt that ice is a great sanitary agent, and ever family ought to be provided with it during th warmer months of the year. It is true that th inordinate use of ice water, or its use under som special conditions and circumstances, is attende with great danger; so is the improper use of an other drink or food. The assumption that ice water is dangerous, and that iced tea, or ice coffee, or iced lemonade is a harmless substitute i simply a delusion. As the source of danger feare by some is the degree of cold, we fail to see clearl how the flavor modifies the effect of temperature There are some individuals, undoubtedly, who ca not drink ice water without injury, and who ough never to use it, but to a great majority of person it is refreshing and healthful. Its use, temperat and discreet, is in no way to be condemned, whic cannot be said of some of its substitutes.—Sani-
tary Volunteer.
A Sanitary Truth What a good thing it would be if the city coul afford to have all the pestiferous weeds cut down If the omuiverous hog was grateful for publi favors, he would show his gratitude by keepin the streets clean of weeds, anyway. But the hog,

The observer at Riddleton makes the followin notes for the month: The monthly mean baromete was about normal, and there were no very hig nor low readings recorded. The temperature was
2°.2 below the 7-year normal, and the maximu was not so high as usual. The early part of th month was cool and the latter was not as warm a usual in June. The rainfall was above normal,
0.69. The greater portion fell in the period fro the 9th to the 20th, Inclusive; enl}'one day fre from precipitation out of a period of twelve!
"While the excessive rain damaged the wheat crop,
it had a beneficial effect on oats and tobacco. Th average cloudiness was greatly in excess, 5.4, an the number of rainy days ways also in excess b one-half The observer at Spfingdale notes as follows con-
cerning crops: Meadows extra f*ie; corn look weM, wheat good; oats much better than ex-
pected; pastures ffne; Irish potatoes extra; appl crop heavy; poaches about half a crop The observer at Florence Station makes the fol-
lowing notes: Mean temperature, 71°.92, 3°.08
loss than the averase temperature of June for si years, 1883- to 1888, inclusive. Rainfall, 4.64
inches, 0.47 inch less than the average for June,
1883, to 1888, inclusiva; total rainfall January 1s to June 30th, inclusive. 22.93 inches; deficiency,
2.33 inches. The average rainfall for July ha been 3.44 inches The observer at Rugby reports that during th heavy storm of the 16th a house was struck b lightning The observer at Dunlap reports that during th storm of the night of the 13th a residence wa struck by lightning; no one injured The observer at Ashwood says: Very we month: rain fell more or less on twelve consecu-
tive days, from 9th to 20th; not much fell at thi ststion, but in the immediate vicinity rain fell i heavy showers nearly every day The observer at Nunnelly furnished the follow-
ing notes for the month: Some of the phenomena features of June were the excess of rainfall, whic amounted to 5.31 inches, which fell on sixtee days, and the continuous cloudiness which almos suspended evaporation and caused the lands to b too wet for tillage up to the last week in th month. It has been comparatively calm durin the month; moderately high winds on the Sth and
16th. Electric disturbance has been largely i excess, almost daily throughout the month. A earthquake on the 5th at 9 p. m., accompanied, b a rumbling sound. The vibrations were distinctly-
felt, lasting 15 or 20 seconds; direction fro which it came was not noted. The force was s great as to nearly overturn burning lamps in th second story of buildings. On the 13th at 4 p. m.
a very bright rainbow, forming a complete arc an reaching from horizon to horizon, all the tints i their brightest eojprs being distinctly defined The left hand base seemed to rest against a fores three-quarters of a mile away, the green fores leaves presenting a pleasant contrast to the varie tints of the rainbow. On the 1st at 9 to 11.30 a.
m. a very brilliant and well defined halo, 24°
diameter, in three distinct colors, the outer pur white, the next a bright yellow, and the inner  bright red The observer at Riddleton furnishes the follow-
ing notes concerning the hail storm of the 3d in
Smith County: The hail storm oT the 3d was th heaviest that has visited this section since th establishment of this station. It was especiall severe in the northwest portion of Smith County The corn crop was damaged to a great extent, th hail stripping all the blades off in places, an beating the stalk down fiat with the ground. Sev-
eral large crops were utterly ruined; had to b plowed up and replanted. The wheat crop fare equally as^bad, the hail stones beating down th stalks and shattering the heads Oats did no suffer so severely, because of younger growth, bu the crop was beaten down to some extent. Frui trees wero stripped of their leaves and most of th fruit, and all trees, vines, weeds and other vegeta-
tion received a full share of the stortn. Ten day later, as seen from the river, the former green,
spring luxuriance was changed to a brownish yel-
low, giving all vegetation a.desolate appearance The storm began at 2 p. m. ahid ended at 4 p. m.;
the hail began at 3 p. m. and ended at 3.15 p. m The size of the stones wero reported to be one-
half to three-quarters of an inch in diameter Sergt. J. B. Marbury, U. S. Observer at Nash-
ville, makes the following notes for month: Th first two days of tho month were remarkably cool

for the season, bringing into requisition discarde clothing and causing tires to be rekindled durin the early morning and at night. The averag temperature for the month was 1° above the low-
est mean for June during the past eighteen years,
while the pressure ranged al>out normal. Th total rainfall, 5.33 inches, is slightly in excess o the normal for June at this station Sergt. L. M. Pindell, U. S. Observer at Chatta-
nooga, gives the data of rainfall for the month a stations outside the State: Murphy, N. C, 6.48
inches; Charleston, N. C, 3.79 inches; ABbeville,
K*. C, 4 51 inches The following is the data for the month of Ma at Tullahoma, the report having been received to late for tabulation: mean temperature, 66°.2;
mean of maximum temperature, 74°.7; mean o minimum temperature. 61°. 1; highest tempera-
ture, 85°, on the 17th and 18th; lowest tempera-
ture, 39°, on the 30th; range of temperature, 46°;
mean daily range, 12°.8; total rainfall, 2.41 inches;
mean daily rainfall, 0.078 inch; greatest rainfal in 24 hours, 0.98 inch, on the 19th; number o clearways. 22; fair days, 7; cloudy days, 2; day of rainfall, 6; prevailing wind, south Observations at Grief and Fostoria, which hav been suspended for several months have been re-
sumed, with good prospects As will be seen by the table elsewhere the defi-
ciency in rainfall from January 1 to June 30 i still great, notwithstanding the large amount tha fell in June It is gratifying to note that the number of ob-
servers show a satisfactory increase by the resump-
tion of work at some of the stations which hav been idle for some time past, also by the additio of new slations, with good observers, who seem t take an interest in the work. The observers wh have all along been so faithful and prompt in thei reports are to be congratulated on the apparent in-
creasing interest shown in their work. Altogether,
we note with pride that the service in the State i in better condition than since its organization,
more than six years ago, and we hope, through th kind and prompt co-operation of our corps of vol-
untary observers, to keep it progressing still highe in the scale of excellence.
